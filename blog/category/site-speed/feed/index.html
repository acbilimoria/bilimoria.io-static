								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: Google doesn&#8217;t like websites with heavy images. They slow down your website and that impacts your SEO. But if you compress your images to speed up your website, their quality will plummet and then your <em>users</em> won&#8217;t like them. So your users bounce and, well, that impacts your SEO.</p>
<p>Optimizing your images can be a double-edged sword, but it&#8217;s also one of the most important things you can do for your website. From making them smaller and quicker to load to adding captions for SEO, optimizing your images is easy to do and doesn&#8217;t need much tech know-how.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re about to learn the simple techniques to shrink your images, hold their quality, and keep both Google <em>and</em> your users happy. Yep, all in less than three minutes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll find in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why optimizing your images can make or break your SEO ranking.</li>
<li>What alt texts are and how to use them for better SEO (and accessibility).</li>
<li>How to choose the best file format for your images.</li>
<li>The simple rule for perfectly sized web images.</li>
<li>Quick tips to ensure your images always appear on Google.</li>
<li>WordPress plugins that can optimize your images in seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to kick bad SEO to the curb? Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2>Why you should optimize your images</h2>
<p>On average, <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images#bytesImg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">images make up over 50%</a> of a total webpage’s weight. If they&#8217;re not optimized, more than half of your website will drag down your page speed and ranking.</p>
<p>Optimizing your images is good for business, not just for SEO but also for the user experience. Here&#8217;s a quick peek of the main benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your pages will load faster which will keep today&#8217;s impatient users on your website longer. They&#8217;ll leave if loading times exceed 2-3 seconds, so every second counts. Check our post on <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to speed up your website</a> for more tips.</li>
<li>Your images will be crawled and indexed by Google so they&#8217;ll appear in search results for users to find. This means more traffic for your site which in turn bumps up your SEO ranking.</li>
<li>Your website will take up less storage space on your server. This is great news if you have a limited web hosting plan. (Check our <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/best-web-hosting-small-business-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beginners guide to web hosting</a> for help on choosing the right host for you.)</li>
<li>Smaller image sizes use less bandwidth, something your mobile users will greatly appreciate. Not to mention Google is big on mobile and if your site doesn&#8217;t work well on the small screen, you&#8217;ll be punished with a lower SEO score.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alt texts and how to use them correctly</h2>
<p>Alternative text is that field you always see beneath an image (no, not the caption. After that).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3605" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alt-text-field-in-wordpress.png" alt="screenshot of alt text field in WordPress" width="280" height="494" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alt-text-field-in-wordpress.png 280w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alt-text-field-in-wordpress-170x300.png 170w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></p>
<p>People either ignore this field completely or stuff it with keywords. But the primary use of alt texts is to give an image description for users who are blind or have low vision.</p>
<p>You see, these users tend to have screen readers that read everything on the website out loud. So if your images don&#8217;t have alt texts, these users simply won&#8217;t know what the image is about.</p>
<p>From an SEO perspective, the alt text serves as an opportunity for search engines to capture keywords in your content. The main thing to remember is to keep alt texts brief and as descriptive and specific as possible.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a good vs bad alt text by <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/image-alt-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubspot</a>. Take a look at the following image:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3606" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Alt-text-example.png" alt="Woman pointing to female student's computer screen in class" width="501" height="332" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Alt-text-example.png 501w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Alt-text-example-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>In their article, Hubspot describes the case of this image being used in a webpage promoting a business school. In this scenario, you&#8217;d want the alt text to include keywords relevant to business schools while also being descriptive enough to form a mental image in people&#8217;s minds.</p>
<p>Bad alt text would go something like, &#8220;Woman pointing to someone&#8217;s computer screen.&#8221; Whereas good alt text would read, &#8220;Business school professor pointing to female student&#8217;s computer screen in class.&#8221;</p>
<p>See how that works?</p>
<h2>Best file formats for your images</h2>
<p>The format you choose for your images can make a world of difference in terms of size and quality. You know about JPEG, PNG, and GIF – but do you know when to use each one for web? We&#8217;ve got you.</p>
<h3><strong>JPEG</strong></h3>
<p>JPEG is arguably the most popular image file format on the web, and for good reason. It&#8217;s ideal for photographs and intensely colorful images, like products and homepage banners.</p>
<p>You can hardly go wrong with JPEG, but there is a small catch. JPEG has two optimization modes: lossy and lossless. Lossy means that your image will be reduced by permanently deleting some information, which in turn degrades the image quality.</p>
<p>With lossy, the more you compress the image, the lower the quality will be. Check the grey area in the images below (courtesy of <a href="https://optimus.keycdn.com/support/lossy-vs-lossless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimus</a>) to see what we mean.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3603" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossy-image-optimization.png" alt="Series of images showing result of lossy compression" width="663" height="189" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossy-image-optimization.png 663w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossy-image-optimization-300x86.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, lossless, as the name suggests, shrinks the image size but doesn&#8217;t delete any information – so the quality stays the same. Granted, the image won&#8217;t get as small as with lossy, but it&#8217;ll look much better to the trained eye.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3604" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossless-image.png" alt="Two images showing results of lossless compression" width="452" height="190" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossless-image.png 452w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossless-image-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></p>
<h3><strong>PNG</strong></h3>
<p>The main thing you need to know about PNG is that it&#8217;s the best format for high-quality images that have transparent layers. If your image has overlays or a transparent background, save it in PNG.</p>
<p>Where PNG is concerned, there&#8217;s PNG-8 and PNG-24. We won&#8217;t get into the technical details, but the higher the number the more colors it can handle. If you&#8217;ve got a logo with two colors in it, go ahead and save space with PNG-8. If you have a complex image or photo, go for PNG-24 so your image doesn&#8217;t end up looking like an 80s video game graphic.</p>
<h3><strong>GIF</strong></h3>
<p>You know what GIFs are, but you&#8217;d be surprised at how many website owners save their product images and logos in GIF under the impression it&#8217;s &#8220;better&#8221;.</p>
<p>Look, if your logo is simple and PNG is still too heavy, then go ahead and save it as a GIF. But for all that is good do <em>not</em> use GIF for product images. They&#8217;ll make your users think they need glasses to see them clearly.</p>
<h2>The best size for web images</h2>
<p>Honestly, there&#8217;s no one size to rule them all. But webmasters generally agree that image dimensions should be anywhere between 1500 &#8211; 2500 px wide. It&#8217;s big enough to maintain the quality, but not so big it&#8217;ll weigh your page down.</p>
<p>As for the size, when in doubt follow the &#8220;200 KB rule,&#8221; which essentially means all your images will be a lot less troublesome if they&#8217;re under 200 KB.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have Photoshop to whittle your images down to size, try any of these free image optimization tools.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gimp</a> (basically a free Photoshop)</li>
<li><a href="https://tinyjpg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TinyJPG</a> or <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TinyPNG</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>How to get your images on Google</h2>
<p>Have you ever Googled your product or service and wondered why it&#8217;s not appearing in Google Images? If you already added alt texts and your images still aren&#8217;t showing, here are a few more things you can do to catch Google&#8217;s attention.</p>
<h3><strong>Name images in plain English</strong></h3>
<p>Unless you know people who type &#8220;image10382365746.png&#8221; in the search bar, your images shouldn&#8217;t be named like that.</p>
<p>Giving your images a proper name that includes your top keywords is a great way to add extra SEO points to your website. Here&#8217;s a short list of tips for naming your images for SEO.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Keep the name to five words or fewer. Google doesn&#8217;t like novels in image names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Use hyphens to separate the words so they&#8217;re clearer to both Google and people. (E.g. &#8220;website-developer-portland&#8221; rather than &#8220;websitedeveloperportland&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Add keywords but don&#8217;t stuff them all in if they&#8217;re not relevant to the image. Say &#8220;website-developer-oregon&#8221; not &#8220;best-website-developer-oregon-java-css-hosting-free-consultation&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make it descriptive enough for anyone to get the gist of what the image is about without having to look at it. Try reading the name out loud to someone as a test.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Add captions to every image</strong></h3>
<p>An empty caption is a missed SEO opportunity. Google crawls captions too so if anyone searches for a keyword that happens to be in one of your captions, they&#8217;ll find your website.</p>
<p>Captions are also helpful little things for users to understand your content better. According to <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/shocking-truth-about-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KissMetrics</a>, captions under images are read 300% more often than the rest of the website.</p>
<p>Writing a good caption is a lot like writing a good image name. Keep it clear and to the point so your users can understand the context of the image. For example, if you have a photo of a sunset, a good caption would be: Sunset on Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
<h3><strong>Generate an image site map</strong></h3>
<p>This one needs a bit more tech-know-how, but it&#8217;s a good way to increase your chances of getting your images found.</p>
<p>If your website is using flashy pop-ups or fancy Javascript image galleries, those images might not get picked up by Google. To help the Google bots find and crawl these images, you can create an image sitemap using generator scripts like <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/images-sitemap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a>. (You can always more information on <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Webmaster Tools</a>).</p>
<h2>WordPress plugins to optimize your images</h2>
<p>Ah, WordPress plugins. There&#8217;s no better way to spare yourself from the troubles of image optimization than installing a plugin. So here&#8217;s a list of the top WordPress plugins for the job.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/imagify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imagify</a>: For bulk optimization and three levels of compression, this plugin is the way to go. It also has a restore feature if you&#8217;re not happy with the final image. More importantly, there&#8217;s a free version you can use.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Smush</a>: This plugin takes all the images you&#8217;ve uploaded and, well, smushes them down to size. It can do it in bulk or manually if you want. And yes, they have a free plan too.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EWWW Image Optimizer</a>: There&#8217;s nothing disgusting about this popular plugin. It&#8217;s easy to use and automatically shrinks your images as soon as you upload them. You don&#8217;t even need to create an account to use it.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/resmushit-image-optimizer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reSmush.it</a>: This one is currently the top-rated WordPress plugin for image optimization. It smushes images automatically and offers a bulk option too. The downside is it limits your uploads to 5MB in size. (Still good for a free plugin though.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your small business website running on WordPress? If yes, then you&#8217;re part of the popular crowd. According to <a href="https://wordpress.com/about/?aff=2718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent stats</a>, WordPress powers about 26% of the world wide web.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise everyone has jumped onto the WordPress train considering it&#8217;s the most powerful and versatile Content Management Systems (CMS) out there. From small travel blogs and burgeoning business websites to Fortune 500s like Sony Music and Forbes blog. WordPress is a force to be reckoned with.
</p>
<p>The problem with WordPress (and most websites) is that it&#8217;s easy to overstuff it with plugins, leave broken links unattended, and bog it down with heavy media. The good news is that all of this and all other slow-loading WordPress problems can be fixed. Quite easily, we might add.
</p>
<p>So, settle into your chair, grab a pen and get ready to learn:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Why your WordPress website is slower than a dial-up connection.</li>
<li>How to check for performance issues in just two clicks.</li>
<li>Five easy tips to kick your slow WordPress website into warp speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Reasons your WordPress website is slow</strong></h2>
<p>Slow websites are the stone in the internet&#8217;s shoe. They&#8217;re annoying and they happen more often than anyone would like.
</p>
<p>When you have a small business website that&#8217;s already struggling for attention, the last thing you need is for it to load at the speed of nothing. In fact, according to SEO guru, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neil Patel</a>, here are a few major reasons how laggy sites can sabotage your business goals.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Slower loading times equal more page abandonments. After 2-3 seconds, poof.</li>
<li>Page speed is a ranking signal at Google. The slower you load, the lower you go. </li>
<li>79% of online shoppers never return to a low-performing website.</li>
<li>Every three seconds you make a visitor wait decreases their satisfaction by 16%.</li>
<li>One second delay can result in a 7% reduction in conversions. Ouch.</li>
</ul>
<p>We won&#8217;t go into too much detail about site speed here (we already did that in our post on <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Everything You Need To Know About Web Speed</a>), so we&#8217;ll jump right into the top reasons why your website is being a right pain.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s bloated with plugins, old scripts, and unused links.</li>
<li>Your hosting provider can&#8217;t keep up with the traffic.</li>
<li>You have way too many heavy images.</li>
<li>Your website isn&#8217;t leveraging caching to load pages faster.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Feeling slightly overwhelmed already? That&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;re here to guide you through it all. Of course, if you&#8217;d rather just have us speed up your website for you so you can focus on other things (like growing your business), drop us a quick message <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>In any case, here&#8217;s how to fix all of these issues and more with a bit of research, the right tools, and some elbow grease.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>First, check how fast your site is loading</strong></h2>
<p>You won&#8217;t know how grave your situation is until you actually check your website speed. You can do this in just a couple of clicks and using tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> (free), <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/?logout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GTMetrix</a> (also free), and <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/product/page-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pingdom</a> (14-day trial).
</p>
<p><img src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Pingdom speed test tool" width="960" height="569" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3583" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test.jpg 960w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test-300x178.jpg 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test-768x455.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" />
</p>
<p>All you have to do is paste your website link and then all will be revealed. If you&#8217;re still not sure whether your website is much faster or slower than most in your industry, check <a href="https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/average-page-load-times-websites-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this page</a> to see how you compare with the current average load times. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Review your plugins</strong></h2>
<p>We know. You love WordPress plugins. The simplicity of installing an entire function on your website without needing any meddling developers is a wonderful thing. Except, every plugin you install adds another bucket of code on your website, and over time, all these scripts and stylesheets slow down your website.
</p>
<p>So what to do? Well, there&#8217;s no other way around it other than manually going through your list of installed plugins and deleting the ones you don&#8217;t <em>really</em> need. If you can replace four individual plugins with an all-in-one version, then do it. In general, 20 plugins is the recommended number for WordPress websites.
</p>
<p>Avoid having multiple plugins that do the same thing (like SEO plugins, for example), and if you have a plugin that you don&#8217;t really understand the point of, <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ask a developer</a> for advice.
</p>
<p>By the way, if you have 30-50+ plugins installed to make your WordPress website just the way you want it, then it&#8217;s very likely you could be in need of a new theme that eliminates the need for all that extra baggage. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Optimize your images</strong></h2>
<p>Images are the best and worst part of any WordPress website. They bring life to what would be a dull, text-laden site but they also weigh it down and slow down page loading times.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, images are easy to optimize. Here are a few things you can do to ensure your images aren&#8217;t bogging down your site.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize the images in Photoshop using the “Save for Web” feature. (PNGs are lighter than JPEGs.)</li>
<li>Run your images through free image optimization tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a>.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Smush</a> plugin to automatically reduce image sizes.</li>
<li>If you have an extensive image gallery on a page, try <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lazy loading them</a>.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Check for broken links and redundant redirects</strong></h2>
<p>Links that are doing nothing other than cluttering your database have no place in your new, ultra-fast WordPress website. There are plenty of free tools that will give you a list of broken links like <a href="https://www.drlinkcheck.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Link Check</a> and <a href="https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dead Link Checker</a>.
</p>
<p>As for redirects, think of these as connecting flights where the more connections you have to take the longer it&#8217;ll take you to reach your final destination. Some redirects are good, but too many will bring your page response time crashing down.
</p>
<p>Use good ol&#8217; <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed</a> to see which redirects are lowering your speed score. Another is<br />
<a href="https://varvy.com/tools/redirects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Redirect Mapper Tool</a>, that focuses on how many redirects your main website URL is putting visitors through.</p>
<p>
Once you&#8217;ve identified the culprits, you can go ahead and start deleting the redirects your website could do without.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Enable browser caching</strong></h2>
<p>Caching is a nifty technique where rarely-changed elements on your website (like your logo, background, etc.) are stored on the visitor&#8217;s computer. So the next time they visit your website, there&#8217;s no need to wait for all those things to download again. This makes your website load twice as fast since half the work has already been done.
</p>
<p>Not only does it save on bandwidth, it also provides a better experience for mobile users (which is more than <a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">52% of all online traffic</a>) – who also happen to be the most impatient.
</p>
<p>To get this magic-sounding thing working for your own WordPress website, the easiest way is to install a plugin. Yes, we know we told you to avoid bloating your website with plugins but technically you&#8217;re allowed 20 and this one is important.
</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Total Cache</a> (totally free), <a href="http://wp-rocket.me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Rocket</a> (paid, but worth it), and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/comet-cache/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comet Cache</a> (free and paid options).
</p>
<p>You can find even more tips and tools for browser caching and learn all the easy ways you can leverage it right <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/how-leverage-browser-caching/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Upgrade your hosting plan</strong></h2>
<p>&#8220;Upgrading&#8221; is not a word you want to hear when the budget is tight, but it may be the only way to get your WordPress website running at top speed.
</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve checked everything else and the need for speed still stands, then chances are you&#8217;re getting more traffic than what your poor hosting server can handle.
</p>
<p>When choosing a hosting plan, you need to make sure it can accommodate the size and expected popularity of your website. Otherwise, it&#8217;ll only sputter and struggle to load your pages and effectively frustrate all your visitors.
</p>
<p>Sometimes all it takes is forking out a little extra dough each month, but other times you need to switch to a faster and better hosting provider altogether. It sounds like a lot, we know, so we made a <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/best-web-hosting-small-business-website/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beginner&#8217;s guide to web hosting</a> so you know which option is best for your webite.    </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Need a hand with your WordPress website?</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, you&#8217;re already much savvier than most small business owners when it comes to making WordPress websites faster. But taking out the time to fix it all yourself isn&#8217;t something everybody wants to bother with.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Redirects are tricky little things. On one hand, they send your visitors to the right pages on your website. On the other hand, the process of sending them causes your pages to load slower than they should.
</p>
<p>Considering users give up on websites if they take <a href="https://www.hobo-web.co.uk/your-website-design-should-load-in-4-seconds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than 2-3 seconds to load</a>, having too many redirects is a troubling problem. Especially if you&#8217;re a small business owner already struggling to usher traffic to your website.
</p>
<p>The good thing about redirects is they&#8217;re easy to catch. We&#8217;ll give you a quick rundown of the topic so you understand exactly what you&#8217;re dealing with. In the next 3-4 minutes, you&#8217;ll learn: </p>
<ul>
<li>What are redirects</li>
<li>How redirects hurt website speed</li>
<li>Free tools to check for redirects</li>
<li>Tips to minimize redirects for an optimized website</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready? Here goes nothin&#8217;.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>What are redirects?</strong></h2>
<p>When you move or delete something on your website, you want your visitors to arrive at the new location, not the old one. Well, a redirect is a function that automatically sends your website visitors to the new location. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Example of a redirect</strong></h2>
<p>Redirects are about as common as cracked iPhone screens. Although there are a few different types of redirects, this is what a typical scenario looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user decides to pop into your website and types &#8220;yourwebsite.com&#8221;</li>
<li>Your redirect kicks in and turns their request into &#8220;www.yourwebsite.com&#8221;</li>
<li>But you added an SSL certificate to secure your website so it redirects again to &#8220;https://yourwebsite.com&#8221;</li>
<li>If your user is somehow still patiently waiting, they&#8217;ll finally land on your website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not very user-friendly, right? To make matters worse, the delay isn&#8217;t SEO-friendly either. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>When it&#8217;s okay to use redirects</strong></h2>
<p>So far, redirects seem tedious (and they are). But there are some good reasons why you would have redirects in the first place. </p>
<ul>
<li>To turn &#8220;yourwebsite.com&#8221; to &#8220;www.yourwebsite.com&#8221; if that&#8217;s the default URL.</li>
<li>Direct traffic and resources to an updated page after you published new content.</li>
<li>Send your visitors to a temporary page while you fix up the current page.</li>
<li>Redirect old URLs to a new permalink structure (if you&#8217;re on WordPress).</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all very valid, in fact, redirecting from a bad page to an updated page is considered a good SEO practice. But some redirects can be avoided or at least shortened so that your visitor has fewer hoops to jump through to get to what they want. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Why do redirects hurt website speed?</strong></h2>
<p>When booking a flight to some balmy destination, which would be faster: the direct flight or the one with multiple connections?
</p>
<p>The problem with redirects is your visitors have to go through one or multiple connections before they land at the new location. Whether it&#8217;s just one connection or various, your page will still take longer to load. And as you know, a slow loading time is something Google notices when ranking your website. (Yes, the dreaded SEO strikes again.)
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the wait is worse for visitors on mobile as they&#8217;re typically on limited data or leeching off free Wi-Fi in a public space. With the number of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mobile phone users forecast to reach 4.68 billion in 2019</a>, you wouldn&#8217;t want your website put on the slow-loading blacklist.
</p>
<p>While there are many steps you can take to <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">make your website load faster</a>, it&#8217;ll never really reach its best speed unless you either reduce or completely eradicate all your redirects.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Wait, what are 301 and 302 redirects?</strong></h2>
<p>Before we get into the tools, it&#8217;s important that you understand the most common types of redirects: 301 redirects and 302 redirects.
</p>
<p>301 redirects are permanent. These are used when a page has been irrevocably moved or deleted and you want to avoid visitors facing a lovely ERROR 404 on the outdated page. Search engines will only display the new page.
</p>
<p>302 redirects are temporary. These are used when you&#8217;re just redirecting traffic to another page for a while. This one is a little confusing for search engines and they may end up displaying both the old and new page in search results. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>How to check for redirects on your website</strong></h2>
<p>Now that&#8217;s over with, you&#8217;ll be glad to know that there is no shortage of tools that scan your website and give you a generous report on all the redirects currently hiding under the hood. The best part is that many of these tools are free. Here&#8217;s a list of the most popular redirect checkers.
</p>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed:</a> You can always count on trusty Google to tell you where you&#8217;re going wrong. Kill two birds with one stone by using this tool to check your page speed plus which redirects are lowering your score.
</p>
<p><a href="https://varvy.com/tools/redirects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Redirect Mapper Tool:</a> This free tool focuses on how many redirects your main website URL is putting visitors through. Is it adding the www and then the https? Or does it go straight to https? If you have more than one redirect, it&#8217;ll let you know.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.giftofspeed.com/broken-requests-test/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Broken Requests Tool:</a> Here&#8217;s another freebie that reveals all your 301 and 302 redirects. Then all you&#8217;ll need to do is carefully investigate each one and decide whether they&#8217;re worth a slower loading time or not.
</p>
<p><a href="http://redirectdetective.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Redirect Detective:</a> This is by no means the prettiest of them all but it sure is useful (and free). If you&#8217;re not sure where a particular URL redirects to, you can paste it in the tool and it&#8217;ll reveal all its secrets.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/redirect-checker/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Screaming Frog Bulk Redirect Checker:</a> Need something a bit more robust? This is a downloadable tool where you can upload up to 500 URLs (with the free plan) and get a complete view of what kind of redirects you have and where they lead to. </p>
<p>Once you have identified the offending redirects, all you have to do is delete the ones you don&#8217;t need. You can do this using your hosting provider&#8217;s control panel, WordPress plugins (which we&#8217;ll mention later), or digging through your htaccess file (if you&#8217;re the tecchy type). </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Tips for minimizing redirects</strong></h2>
<p>You know how much we love giving tips. Here are a few things you can do to keep your redirects low for a truly optimized website. </p>
<ul>
<li>Never link to a page that you know has a redirect on it. It will only lead to multiple redirects and a very frustrated visitor.</li>
<li>Plugins can result in unnecessary redirects, so make sure to clear out any plugins that you don&#8217;t really need.
<li>Regularly scan your website for old redirects that lead to pages you deleted a long time ago. This is a good practice after <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/best-web-hosting-small-business-website/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">switching hosting providers</a> or making large content changes to your website.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, try the <a href="https://en-us.wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Redirection plugin</a> for alerts on new redirects, 404 errors, and any loose ends that you&#8217;re not aware of.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Need help cleaning up your redirects?</strong></h2>
<p>Keeping your website neat and tidy while running a business is a bit much to ask. Why not hand over the task of minimizing redirects and optimizing your website to someone else?

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just when you have your website set up and everything is going swell, you catch a glimpse of a whole new thing that you may or may not need. Great, another thing to research.
</p>
<p>So now you&#8217;re here after going through a bunch of dismal blogs and barely-trying infographics on CDNs which have somehow managed to give you a cloudy idea of what it&#8217;s all about.
</p>
<p>Do you *really* need to use a CDN or is it just a fad? And how the heck does it all tie in with your hosting? Look, we like to use plain English around here and we promise you won&#8217;t need to click on any more search results after this.
</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll learn in this post: </p>
<ul>
<li>What is a CDN and how it can make your website load 10x faster for your users.</li>
<li>The hottest benefits of using a CDN that can make or break your online business.</li>
<li>Three simple ways to tell if you need a CDN and when NOT to use one.</li>
<li>How to get started with a CDN in just a few minutes using either free or paid companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Sounds promising? Let&#8217;s crack on.   </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>What is a CDN?</strong></h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing: The closer a server is to the end user, the faster and better your website will be for them. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) basically spread out servers across the world to quickly send your web content to the users closest to them.
</p>
<p>Say your website is hosted on a server that&#8217;s sitting in the US. While your local visitors are enjoying super fast loading times, your European customers are struggling to shop on your unbearably slow website.
</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t need to tell you how important <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">website speed</a> is for business. A few seconds delay can cost you a sale, which makes CDNs the saving grace for business owners with customers in far-flung places.   </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>How do CDNs work?</strong></h2>
<p>In the simplest terms, the CDN servers copy your website content from the main hosting server, then they cache it and shoot it over to nearby website visitors.
</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re more of a visual learner, take a look at these helpful images from <a href="https://www.leaseweb.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Leaseweb</a>.
</p>
<p><img src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Without_CDN-1024x486.png" alt="" width="1024" height="486" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3515" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Without_CDN-1024x486.png 1024w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Without_CDN-300x143.png 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Without_CDN-768x365.png 768w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Without_CDN.png 1402w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /> Without a CDN
</p>
<p><img src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/With_CDN-1024x486.png" alt="With a CDN" width="1024" height="486" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3516" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/With_CDN-1024x486.png 1024w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/With_CDN-300x143.png 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/With_CDN-768x365.png 768w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/With_CDN.png 1402w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />
</p>
<p>As you can see, no CDN means longer wait times and more bandwidth usage while your website content chugs halfway across the globe. On the other hand, CDNs close the gap between the server and a distant website visitor so they can get what they want from your website like a local. And who doesn&#8217;t like the convenience of being local?
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>What&#8217;s the difference between web hosting and CDN?</strong></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s clear this up once and for all. A CDN isn&#8217;t the same as a web host, it&#8217;s more like an extra layer of hosting.
</p>
<p>Think of your hosting provider as a manufacturer and the CDN servers as your retailers. The CDN&#8217;s main job is to distribute your content to your visitors in the most convenient way possible. Bottom line is: you still need a web host whether you use a CDN or not.
</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you&#8217;re just getting started with your website, you might like our <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/best-web-hosting-small-business-website/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beginner&#8217;s guide to web hosting</a>.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Benefits of using a CDN</strong></h2>
<p>Okay, so now you know what a CDN does and why it&#8217;s kind of important. Now let&#8217;s look at the cold, hard benefits that may nudge you over to the CDN side.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased website speed:</strong> When hoards of visitors clog one server, your website is doomed to be sluggish. CDNs relieve the pressure by redirecting those visitors based on where they&#8217;re located. This means reduced loading times and a better user experience for each and every one of them.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Better stability:</strong> Exploding traffic can overwhelm the server and cause your website to fail, resulting in lost customers (and money). The popular website <em>WPBeginner</em> used to have an embarrassingly high bounce rate due to traffic spikes which led to website failures. Once they adopted a CDN, their <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/why-you-need-a-cdn-for-your-wordpress-blog-infographic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bounce rate dropped and their page views soared</a>.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>SEO:</strong> You knew this was bound to be in here somewhere. Yep, a CDN can help you rank higher thanks to the faster loading times and increased stability. Bet you like CDNs a little more now.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>How to tell if you need a CDN</strong></h2>
<p>By now you&#8217;ve caught onto the notion that a CDN is great if your website caters to a global audience or if you&#8217;re getting a huge amount of traffic. If your current situation fits into either of those categories, then yes, you could definitely benefit from a CDN.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you&#8217;re running a small, local business website then you probably don&#8217;t need a CDN (yet). The moment you start to scale and gain international attention, you can start thinking about using a handy network to relieve your web hosting server from the overflowing traffic.
</p>
<p>Of course, another reason you might not want to use a CDN is simply that it&#8217;s an added expense (and a steep one at that.) If you&#8217;re a small business owner just starting out, then a CDN should be the least of your priorities.<br />

</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Getting started: Top free and paid CDNs</strong></h2>
<p>Congratulations on getting this far. Since you&#8217;re here, we&#8217;ll save you a Google search and give you a vetted list of the top CDN companies to choose from.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h3>Top free CDNs</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cloudflare</a>:</strong> This is one of the most popular options on the CDN market. You can go with their free plan or pay for an upgraded one. The free version is pretty loaded with features (like spam protection) and Cloudfare is famously secure.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.jsdelivr.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jsDeliver</a>:</strong> This is an open-source CDN which makes it very developer-friendly and also free for everyone. One cool feature about this CDN is the unlimited bandwitch, so it&#8217;s definitely worth a look.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong><a href="http://jetpack.me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Photon (Jetpack)</a></strong> Here&#8217;s one for the WordPress website owners. Photon is a free WP plugin that leverages CDN to optimize the loading time of your images. It&#8217;s not an all-in-one solution but it sure is useful if your site is image-heavy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></p>
<h3>Top paid CDNs</strong></h3>
<ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the best web host starts out like every other choice. You look it up online and hope to find a clear-cut solution that fits your website like a glove. But then you find yourself faced with unfamiliar terms like &#8220;shared hosting&#8221; and &#8220;managed hosting.&#8221; Now you&#8217;re worried about whether you&#8217;re truly choosing the right option.
</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re here, chances are you&#8217;re brimming with questions. Which web host is best for your website? How can you make sure you&#8217;re getting your money&#8217;s worth? How much server space do you really need? Wait, what&#8217;s the difference between web hosting and a web domain anyway?
</p>
<p>As a small business owner, these concerns are magnified as you&#8217;re likely firing up your website on a budget. Here&#8217;s where we can help you. (You can also just <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact">contact us</a> right now if you&#8217;d rather have someone take care of it for you.)
</p>
<p>We want to make your life easier so we put together this essential guide for barely tech-savvy, small business owners looking to nab the best web hosting.
</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll give you a practical rundown of the main types of web hosting, sneaky things you should look out for, and tried and true tips to make sure you&#8217;re making the right choice. So take a deep breath, count to ten, and read on.  </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>What is web hosting?</strong></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start at the top. Web hosting is a service that lets you post your website on the internet.
</p>
<p>Think of it this way: a website is like a physical store. When people want to visit it, they look up the address (your domain) and then when they want to see something or make a purchase, they ask the clerk (your web host) to show it to them.
</p>
<p>Back into slightly more technical terms, your web host is where all your website&#8217;s files live. They&#8217;re stored on a server (or bunch of servers) which the web host dips into and sends the right files to your users&#8217; computer through their web browser.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Why is a good web host important?</strong></h2>
<p>You know the general reason why a good web host is not something that should be chosen lightly. But it&#8217;s common for website owners to overlook a few important details and only realize what they&#8217;re missing <em>after</em> they&#8217;ve typed in their credit card information.
</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s avoid you becoming one of them, shall we?
</p>
<h3><strong>1. Keeping your website online</strong></h3>
<p>If you go for the super budgeted option you found on a seedy-looking site, then your website will probably be offline more often than you&#8217;d like (which is never).
</p>
<p>Turns out lots of web hosting providers will oversell their resources and then not be able to keep up with the demand. So you&#8217;ll end up losing a lot of business when potential customers click on your website with all the hope in the world, just to find it&#8217;s offline. Talk about money down the drain.
</p>
<p>So when you&#8217;re scanning web hosting providers trying to find how they plan to keep your business up and running, look for the words &#8220;guaranteed uptime&#8221; or anything addressing their plan of action if your website ever goes offline.
</p>
<h3><strong>2. Loading your website quickly</strong></h3>
<p>In our practical guide covering <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/">all you need to know about website speed</a>, we mentioned that the ideal server response time is 200 milliseconds &#8212; which isn&#8217;t long at all.
</p>
<p>If your web hosting provider is cheap then their equipment will also be cheap. Which usually means their services will be slow and their poor server will choke up trying to assist all your website visitors simultaneously.
</p>
<p>Not to mention many web hosts set tight limits on the amount of traffic and bandwidth you can have, which only slows down your website even more and also frustrates your visitors.
</p>
<h3><strong>3. Ranking high in search results</strong></h3>
<p>SEO just follows you around like a cloud of angry bees, doesn&#8217;t it? But yes, your web host can affect your ranking if your website is slow or almost always offline.
</p>
<p>In fact, Google actually punishes websites that go down more often than is reasonable. So it&#8217;s worth spending a little more to make sure your website stays on Google&#8217;s good side.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>What are the types of web hosting services?</strong></h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s where business owners start to wring their hands. There are various types of web hosting and the right one for you depends on what you&#8217;ll be using it for. Here are your main options and when you should choose them.
</p>
<h3><strong>Shared hosting vs. Dedicated hosting</strong></h3>
<p>In a nutshell, shared hosting means you share a server with other people. It&#8217;s a bit like sharing your Wi-Fi with your neighbor, it&#8217;s slower than if you had the connection to yourself, but it&#8217;s also cheaper to pay for.
</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably already figured out what dedicated hosting means. Yep, you got it. It means you get a server all to yourself. You could say it&#8217;s the VIP of web hosting.
</p>
<p>Which one is best for you? Well, if you have a small website and don&#8217;t really expect a million visits per day, then you&#8217;ll do just fine on a shared server. Plus, as a new website owner, it&#8217;s good to start small then scale up when you&#8217;re ready.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you plan on having a seriously popular website (we&#8217;re talking Instagram model popular), then get that baby onto its own dedicated server for faster service and fewer limitations.
</p>
<h3><strong>Managed hosting vs. Collocated or Self-service hosting</strong></h3>
<p>Managed web hosting is a form of dedicated hosting. You pay for an entire server and have the web hosting provider take care of the complicated stuff like server setup, hardware and software maintenance, security and backups, customer support, all that good stuff.
</p>
<p>Managed web hosting is a great option for small to medium businesses who need the space but don&#8217;t have the means or the IT team to keep everything running smoothly.
</p>
<p>Collocated web hosting basically means you B.Y.O.S (Bring Your Own Server). You rent a space in a data center&#8217;s dark room of servers and pay them to keep an eye on your equipment for you. But you&#8217;re in charge of backups and all the technical software stuff. So maybe don&#8217;t choose this option if you&#8217;re not all that tech-savvy.
</p>
<p>Self-service hosting is a step further. You do it all yourself. You set up your server at home and keep your computer running all day long so your website stays online. (Just imagine the electrical bills.)
</p>
<p>Sounds simple? It&#8217;s not if you&#8217;re an innocent small business owner. You&#8217;ll be in charge of power, cooling, backups, security, software updates, the list goes on. Stay away from this option unless you really know what you&#8217;re doing.
</p>
<h3><strong>Website builder vs. WordPress web hosting</strong></h3>
<p>Have you seen those helpful sites like Wix and Squarespace where you can drag-and-drop an entire website and they take care of pretty much everything? That&#8217;s website builder hosting. It&#8217;s a simple option for small websites like an online portfolio or a blog. Nothing too complicated.
</p>
<p>WordPress web hosting sounds exactly like what you think it is. It&#8217;s where a hosting provider sets up your website based on WordPress&#8217; specific needs (security, software updates, etc.). So if you have a WordPress website, this is the option for you.
</p>
<h3><strong>Bonus: Static web hosting</strong></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s one you don&#8217;t see all that often, but it&#8217;s the cheapest one around. You see, a static website is like a poster on the internet. You just have some text and media up there that won&#8217;t change all that often. There are no fancy log ins or even a server sending your visitors any files.
</p>
<p>Why bother with a website like this? Well, say you have a restaurant and just want to put the menu up with your contact details. Or you&#8217;re hosting an event and only need a page with videos and images for people without social media to access.
</p>
<p>With static websites, there&#8217;s no Content Management System (CMS) like WordPress or Joomla involved. It&#8217;s just a simple, no-fuss website. Providers like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon S3</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> are popular ways to host these static sites. Just a little something for you to consider.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>What to look for in a web host?</strong></h2>
<p>Ah, the million-dollar question (after &#8220;how to make a million dollars&#8221;). While price is always a major factor, you&#8217;ll need to look beyond your wallet when choosing the best web host for your business.
</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re hosting ten websites or a simple blog on your love of blue cheese, you should always make sure your future web host has the following essential things.
</p>
<h3><strong>24/7 support</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine your website is online and business is booming. Then suddenly, on a rainy Friday night, you get an email notification that your website is offline. You&#8217;re losing money every minute that goes by but nobody over at your web hosting provider is answering.
</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t they have a phone number!? Oh wait, is that an email from them? &#8230;And it&#8217;s an automated response saying support hours start on Monday from 9-5.
</p>
<p>This is a very common pickle to be in for many website owners. But it&#8217;s also a very avoidable one. When checking out web hosting providers, always look for their support hours and how you can contact them. If it&#8217;s only via email, there&#8217;s a good chance it&#8217;ll be slow. Look for live chat support and social media messaging to be safe.
</p>
<h3><strong>Security and backups</strong></h3>
<p>The last thing you want is to lose everything after some punk across the world decided to hack your website. Cyber attacks are getting all too common nowadays, so it&#8217;s important that your web host is prepared for them.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your website just happens to have a bad day and fail because a) the server experienced an outage, or b) life is unfair; you&#8217;ll want to know that your web host regularly makes backups of your site so you can just put everything back the way it was.
</p>
<h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>
<p>Can you add more than one domain? Will you get an email with your domain name to look professional? What e-commerce options do they offer? Here&#8217;s where you go nuts with the questions that are specific to the kind of website you&#8217;re looking to set up.
</p>
<p>If their plans and FAQ pages aren&#8217;t helpful, get in touch with them and get all the answers you need before pulling up your credit card.
</p>
<h3><strong>A reliable reputation</strong></h3>
<p>This is an important one. Make sure the web host is the real deal by putting on your detective hat and doing a bit of research. Look up their name and add the word &#8220;reviews&#8221; to your search to see what others are saying about it. Dive into forums and check their online feedback from around the web. (Be very aware if you can&#8217;t find much about them!)
</p>
<p>Taking a few extra minutes to check if they&#8217;re an established provider can make all the difference between a reliable service and a company that takes your money then packs up and leaves. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/hosting-reviews/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of reviewed hosting services</a> you might want to start with.
</p>
<h3><strong>Reasonable fees</strong></h3>
<p>We said &#8220;look beyond the price&#8221;, not ignore it completely! Lots of web hosts offer convenient web hosting plans with attractive signup prices, but some of them like to tack on sneaky fees when they renew your package a year later. So make sure you check all the prices, including future ones if you ever want an upgrade.
</p>
<p>Again, we insist, do try your best not get sucked into the cheapest provider you can find. Sometimes going cheap will end up being twice as expensive in the long run. Always go for quality over quantity. This is your business, after all.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Want more help setting up your website?</strong></h2>
<p>After reading this you should feel at least a teensy bit more confident about choosing the best web host for your small business. But we get it, you&#8217;re a busy person, tech-speak is boring, and you don&#8217;t really want to deal with all the fine print involved in getting everything set up.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating your very own small business website sure is exciting. That is until you realize everything that&#8217;s actually involved. </p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t the 90s anymore. Nowadays you can simply pick a theme and whip up a professional looking website to bring in the traffic and nail those sales.</p>
<p>We can already hear you muttering, &#8220;Yeah, but it&#8217;s easier said than done,&#8221; and you&#8217;re right. But you know what? Building a website is one of the most powerful things you can do for your business. With most of society constantly connected to the internet, putting your biz online skyrockets your exposure and brings you closer to financial freedom (or a yacht).</p>
<p>So whether you&#8217;re finally bringing your business to the 21st century or simply hoping to quit your day job, here&#8217;s a straightforward small business website checklist so you can be sure you&#8217;ve covered all your bases.</p>
<h2>Make your website SEO-friendly</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, good SEO = higher ranking in search results. </p>
<p>Essentially, the better you rank in search engines, like Google, the more exposure your business gets. While you can always hire a fancy SEO expert to really dig into it, there are a few basic things you can do yourself to lift your website off the ground.</p>
<h3>Insert keywords in titles, meta-descriptions, and tags</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t do SEO without keywords. If you already know which keywords your business is targeting then you&#8217;re miles ahead. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re just getting started you can use free tools like <a href="https://adwords.google.com/intl/en_ca/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Keyword Planner</a>, <a href="https://keywordtool.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keyword Tool</a>, and <a href="https://answerthepublic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Answer The Public</a> to see what your audience is typing.</p>
<p>Once you have a list of your top 3-5 keywords, put them in your titles, headers, links, and tags. For example, if you want your homepage to attract people searching for &#8220;disco dog collars&#8221;, use the top keywords used in dog collar web searches. </p>
<p>Pay special attention to the places that people see when deciding whether to click on your website or not. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3416 size-full" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bilimoria-tech-reviews.png" alt="screenshot of bilimoria search engine listing" width="598" height="132" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bilimoria-tech-reviews.png 598w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bilimoria-tech-reviews-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></p>
<p>Note how the keyword &#8220;Bilimoria Technologies&#8221; (that&#8217;s us) is in the blue title, the green link (URL), and the meta-description. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re running your website on WordPress, you can install nifty plugins like<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> All In One SEO Pack</a> or <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YoastSEO</a> which make sure you fill in all those important fields for every page on your website.</p>
<h3><strong>Track your traffic with Google Analytics</strong></h3>
<p>After you&#8217;ve done your SEO homework, you&#8217;re going to want to see if it&#8217;s working. There&#8217;s plenty of software available to track your web analytics, but for beginners, it&#8217;s safer to go with <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a>. (Plus it&#8217;s free.)</p>
<p>All you have to do is head over there, create an account, and then verify that your website is actually yours (and you&#8217;re not trying to spy on someone else&#8217;s). After that, you can check your dashboard to see how many people are coming in, what they&#8217;re clicking on, and where your SEO is falling flat.</p>
<h3>Fill it with clear and consistent content</h3>
<p>Content is a major driver of clicks, and the whole point of getting a website is to show people that you have what they need. The only way to do that is with good content. </p>
<p>For content that draws in eyeballs and gets fingers clicking, try to hit everything on this list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branding:</strong> Your logo should be in the top left corner and your brand name should be the first thing they read, followed by a tagline that tells them <em>exactly</em> what you offer. (Don&#8217;t say &#8220;We make quality shoes&#8221;, say &#8220;Custom-made shoes for senior citizens.&#8221; Be as specific as you can.)</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Scannability:</strong> Use short paragraphs (no more than four sentences) and bullet points whenever you can. Remember, people don&#8217;t read online, they <em>skim</em>.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Easy-to-read:</strong> Avoid the quirky lingo and unexplained acronyms. Read your content out loud to make sure it sounds like something an actual human would say in a conversation. If it sounds salesy or unnatural, cut it out.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> Use good quality images and videos to complement your text. Be careful though, these can be heavy and tend to slow down your website. (We&#8217;ll talk a bit more about that later.)</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Blog:</strong> Most companies use a blog to bring in more views. If you don&#8217;t have the time (or the money to hire someone), just focus on essential content like the homepage, about page, services, FAQ, and contact page.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Call to action:</strong> What do you want their next step to be? Do you want them to subscribe to your newsletter? Click the giant orange button to buy your product? Tell them what to do with a helpful call to action (CTA).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a small business homepage that includes all of these things:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3418 size-full" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot.png" alt="Screenshot of Topspot homepage" width="1411" height="797" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot.png 1411w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot-300x169.png 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot-768x434.png 768w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot-1024x578.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1411px) 100vw, 1411px" /></p>
<p>See? Plus, they have what we&#8217;re about to cover next.</p>
<h3>Add social media</h3>
<p>Have you noticed that search engines are showing more content from social media? That&#8217;s because social content is highly valued nowadays and it would do you good to join the movement. Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn are major social networks where you&#8217;ll want to make your presence known.</p>
<p>But hold on there, don&#8217;t just create the pages and hope people will find you. Be active on them, promote your services and add the social icons on every page of your website. (A good place to put them is in the header and/or footer since those are present on every page of your website.)</p>
<h2>Speed: Optimize your website</h2>
<p><a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website speed</a> is just as important as SEO. In fact, slow websites can <em>actually hurt</em> your SEO. To make matters worse, websites that take more than two seconds to load <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lose 53% of potential customers</a>. Harsh, but true. </p>
<p>So to keep your visitors happy and increase your chances of turning them into customers, here are a few essentials to <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">optimize your website</a>.</p>
<h3>Compress your images</h3>
<p>Remember when we said images and videos can be really heavy and slow down your site? Well, this is how you can nip that in the bud. Compressing images simply means making them smaller so your website can load them faster.</p>
<p>Unless you have a website developer doing this for you, go ahead and use free tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TinyPNG</a> or the desktop app <a href="http://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RIOT</a> to really slim those images down before adding them to your site. </p>
<p>For WordPress websites, simply install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Smush</a> plugin and it&#8217;ll take care of your images automatically.</p>
<h3>Make it mobile-friendly</h3>
<p>Fun fact: <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1185/mobile-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40% of online shoppers</a> are on mobile. This means you need to make your website fast and easy for them to access on their devices. </p>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s easy to find a website theme that&#8217;s already mobile-friendly, but once you start adding this and tweaking that, you&#8217;ll find that not everything fits perfectly on the small screen anymore.</p>
<p>Since you&#8217;re just starting out, you don&#8217;t have to worry about the effects of customization just yet (but keep it in mind). Right now, simply take extra care to choose a website theme that explicitly says it&#8217;s &#8220;responsive&#8221; or &#8220;mobile-friendly&#8221;. This way you can focus on your content without worrying if it&#8217;s going to look like a Picasso on mobile.</p>
<h3>Run it through a speed test</h3>
<p>To make sure your website is making the cut, you can copy and paste your web link into <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s PageSpeed Insights</a>. It&#8217;ll give you a score and then a bunch of advice on what needs to be improved. <br />
<strong>Fair warning:</strong> Google&#8217;s advice can get a little technical, but you can find every point explained (in plain English) in this enlightening <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website speed guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Bonus: Add a lazy loading plugin</h3>
<p>E-commerce websites tend to be very image-heavy and this can really slow things down. There&#8217;s a little trick called Lazy Loading where you can make the important images show faster. To get the scoop on this nifty tactic, head over to our <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Guide for Lazy Loading Images</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Design: Make it easy on the eyes</h2>
<p>Humans are instinctively drawn to beautiful things. If your website is easy on the eyes then you&#8217;ll have a leg up on all those Quasimodo-looking sites out there. Here&#8217;s how you can drastically reduce your chances of ending up with an ugly website.</p>
<h3>Start with an aesthetic theme</h3>
<p>If you stick to an attractive theme it&#8217;s pretty hard to mess it up. You don&#8217;t need to be an expert designer to make a beautiful website. Just follow the theme, use quality images, and have the common sense to not put red text on a red background.</p>
<h3><strong>Stick to 3-4 colors</strong></h3>
<p>Okay, usually themes have color pickers and here is where it can all go wrong. We get it, colors add pizzazz to any website. But there&#8217;s no need to use the entire rainbow. </p>
<p>All you really need is a white background, black/grey text, and two other colors to make a few titles and buttons stand out. That&#8217;s it. If you&#8217;re clueless at choosing colors, use this nifty <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">color theme generator</a> to find your perfect business hues.</p>
<h3>Keep it simple</h3>
<p>Resist the temptation to fill in every empty corner of your website. White space makes it look clean and uncluttered, so allow your content to breathe and don&#8217;t stuff in a billion images and ten different fonts. </p>
<p>If you need a bit more guidance, check out <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/websites/business-corporate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these award-winning business websites</a> for some good ol&#8217; design inspiration.</p>
<h2>Need a hand setting up your website?</h2>
<p>While this small business website checklist is pretty short and sweet (if we may say so ourselves), it doesn&#8217;t cover <em>everything</em> you need to know. There&#8217;s hosting, customized features, advanced optimization &#8212; you name it. If this is your very first website it can be a lot to take in, so it doesn&#8217;t hurt if you get someone who has more experience to help you out.</p>
<p>Here at Bilimoria Tech we know it&#8217;s overwhelming to set up this key asset for your business, so we&#8217;re here to help. We&#8217;ll sit down with you (or call you) and guide you through every step of the way so you can feel relieved that your business is in good hands. The best part? The consultation is totally free.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Browser caching. You’ve heard of it, you guess it’s important, but you’re not entirely sure what it is or what to do with it.</p>
<p>You may have spotted the phrase &#8220;browser caching&#8221; while poking around your web host or during your many hours scrolling through tutorials on <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to speed up your website</a>. It’s also the first thing tech support mentions to you when you’re complaining about a website not looking right.</p>
<p>So what is this mysterious concept? How does it benefit you and why should website owners leverage it? All your burning questions will be answered right here.</p>
<h2>What’s browser caching?</h2>
<p>Imagine two guys sitting in a library with their laptops. They both want to watch a movie, so the first guy (we’ll call him Boris) decides to download it, while the second guy (Carl) streams it. </p>
<p>The next day, both guys want to watch that same movie again. Boris, already having it downloaded on his laptop, simply opens it up and begins to watch. But Carl has to go online and stream it all over again. While Boris is already past the opening credits, Carl is still waiting for his slow internet connection to buffer the movie. Poor Carl.</p>
<p>If you replace the &#8220;movie&#8221; with a website, then Boris would be the guy using browser caching. Caching is what happens when parts of a recently visited website are temporarily stored in your computer. This makes the website quicker to load next time because it already has some of it.</p>
<p>Still with us? Good. Now let’s expand on that definition a little so you can really say you get it.</p>
<p>Browser caching is a technique that strikes as soon as you load a website. It sniffs around, checking for elements it can safely store away. These elements are things that won’t likely change anytime soon, like logos, banners, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. They’re then smuggled into the browser’s cache (a file on your computer), so the next time you visit that same web page, those elements just pop right up instead of being slowly downloaded all over again.</p>
<p>Makes sense? If it’s still a bit hazy, keep reading, it’ll get clearer as you go.</p>
<h2>What are the benefits of browser caching?</h2>
<p>You’ve probably already gleaned the main benefit from the movie analogy. It’s the same as keeping a water bottle nearby so you don’t have to go to the tap for a drink every time you’re thirsty. Like bringing your library books to the table instead of walking over to the shelves to read. </p>
<p>See where we’re going with this? It’s all about saving time and getting what you want faster.</p>
<p>Thanks to this nifty technique, the next time you visit a website your browser will quickly pull up what you already have in your cache and then just download the new stuff.</p>
<p>To wrap this up, here’s a quick list of the benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser caching allows web pages to load faster</li>
<li>It saves extra effort and bandwidth for both you and the server</li>
<li>It’s especially useful when you have a slow internet connection</li>
<li>It keeps most of us from throwing our computer out the window.</li>
</ul>
<h2>As a website owner, why is browser caching important?</h2>
<p>That’s a fair question. We’ve already gone through why browser caching is important for essentially everyone who uses the internet. But why is it such a big deal for <i>website owners</i>?</p>
<p><b>Improved website speed</b> As you know, web speed is an important element for success on the internet nowadays. Not only does <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">Google consider web speed</a> when ranking your website, but users <i>hate</i> waiting for websites to load and will <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">leave after three seconds</a>. Ouch.</p>
<p><b>Better user experience </b>With faster websites, come happier visitors. If they have to wait for your logo to load every time they click on a new page, they’re going to get frustrated and exit. That’s bad news for your conversions, your SEO, and your bottom line. So make your users happy.</p>
<p><b>Friendlier for mobile users</b> With <a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018">52% of online web traffic coming from mobile</a>, it’s pretty important for your website to be mobile-friendly. <br />Browser caching helps to cut down on data usage, which we all know is the main worry for most mobile users. The less bandwidth your website uses, the longer they’ll stick around on it.</p>
<h2>Any disadvantages to browser caching?</h2>
<p>As with everything good in this world, there are always pitfalls you should be mindful of.</p>
<p>The fact that browser caching stores your website’s images and resources on people’s computers can be both good and bad. You already know about the good, so let’s skip straight to the ugly.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you just swapped out your logo. You proudly make your changes live, and then ask a friend how it looks on their side. Your friend seems confused, they’re seeing the same logo you had before. They send a screenshot to prove it too. What the heck?</p>
<p>You have caching to thank for that. Users will see what their browsers have already stored, so if you make a change on your website, they may not see it until they manually clear their cache or their cache expires. (We&#8217;ll talk about expiring cache later.)</p>
<p>Worried? Don’t be, there are ways around this. Plus, if you have <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact">someone savvy managing your website</a> then you can always rely on them to sort it all out for you.</p>
<h2>How to leverage browser caching?</h2>
<p>Ah, the big question. Now there’s a bit of tech stuff that needs to happen to properly leverage browser caching, but you can still leave here with a basic action plan or at least a good idea of what it’s all about.</p>
<p>The first move is to run your webpage through Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights</a>. It&#8217;ll likely show &#8220;leverage browser caching&#8221; in the recommendations with a list of files that you should set expiry dates for.</p>
<p> So what does it mean by &#8220;expiry dates&#8221; and how do you set them? Well, there&#8217;s the manual way and the easy way. We&#8217;ll show you both.</p>
<h3>Set an expiry date for your website files</h3>
<p>The point of setting expiry dates for your files is so that browser caches don&#8217;t stay stuck with the old versions of your website&#8217;s files forever.</p>
<p>For example, if you&#8217;re going to change your website&#8217;s background every month, then you&#8217;d set the expiry date to one month so your visitors will see the change 30 days from their last access. On the other hand, if you know you&#8217;re rarely going to change your logo then you can go ahead and set its expiry date to a year (which is the longest recommended time).</p>
<p>To actually do this, you&#8217;re going to need to get your fingers typing (or <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact/">ask a developer</a>).</p>
<p>Ready? Okay, here goes.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, head over to your web host (HostGator, Bluehost, etc.), your FileZilla, or whatever you’re using to manage your website&#8217;s files.</li>
<li>Dig around for a file called &#8220;.htaccess&#8221;. It&#8217;s typically in the &#8220;root&#8221; or the &#8220;www&#8221; folder.</li>
<li>Hold it! Make a copy of it first, just in case. Now, open it in a text editor and paste the following at the top.
<pre>      ## EXPIRES CACHING ##
      &lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&gt;
      ExpiresActive On
      ExpiresByType image/jpg "access 1 year"
      ExpiresByType image/jpeg "access 1 year"
      ExpiresByType image/gif "access 1 year"
      ExpiresByType image/png "access 1 year"
      ExpiresByType text/css "access 1 month"
      ExpiresByType text/html "access 1 month"
      ExpiresByType application/pdf "access 1 month"
      ExpiresByType text/x-javascript "access 1 month"
      ExpiresByType application/x-shockwave-flash "access 1 month"
      ExpiresByType image/x-icon "access 1 year"
      ExpiresDefault "access 1 month"
      &lt;/IfModule&gt;
      ## EXPIRES CACHING ##
</pre>
</li>
<li>Save the file and refresh your webpage. You’re done! That wasn’t too painful, right?</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> If you look carefully, you&#8217;ll see this code is just a list of file types (jpg, css, etc.) with an expiry period next to them (1 month, 1 year). Feel free to change these. If you think you want your gifs to expire sooner, you just have to switch &#8220;1 year&#8221; to &#8220;1 month.&#8221; Nothing too scary.</p>
<h3>Install a browser caching plugin</h3>
<p>Now for the easiest way. If your website is running on WordPress, then you can use a plugin to help you define how your website&#8217;s caching will work for all your online visitors. </p>
<p>But since we&#8217;re so nice, we&#8217;ll give you a list of the most popular browser caching plugins right here.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a>: Here&#8217;s a no-frills caching solution that&#8217;s priced at the amazing value of free. It works well for mobile users and also supports Content Delivery Networks (CDN) &#8212; if you’re into that.</p>
<p><a href="http://wp-rocket.me/">WP Rocket:</a> With this plugin you can kill two birds with one stone. It takes care of caching and also improves web speed through minifying code and <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lazy loading images</a>. It&#8217;s also very easy to use for the non-techies among us. Only downside is that it&#8217;s not free. Can&#8217;t have it all.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a>: This is one of the most popular kids. It takes care of web speed and has a page for every type of file you&#8217;d want to define your caching settings. It can look overwhelming at first, but you can always use the default options and call it a day. You won&#8217;t get more customization than with this fellow right here. Oh, did we mention it&#8217;s free?</p>
<h2>Want help leveraging browser caching for your website?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s okay, you don&#8217;t have to do <i>everything</i> yourself. The important part is you now have a pretty good understanding of browser caching. You can also have smart conversations with a developer about it, and know what you&#8217;re paying for if they offer to &#8220;leverage your website&#8217;s browser caching&#8221;.</p>
<p>But now that you&#8217;ve seen how browser caching can improve your website&#8217;s speed, user experience, and conversions, your next step is likely to get someone tech-savvy and reliable to do it for you. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few things in life make you want to throw your laptop out the window as a slow loading website can. These sloths of the internet are about as fun as a dial-up connection. And you already know one of the main culprits. Yep, you got it. <b>Images.</b><br />
<br />
But as a website owner, what can you do? Images make up <a href="http://httparchive.org/interesting.php?a=All&amp;l=Mar%2015%202017#bytesperpage">65% of all web content</a>. Not to mention users love looking at them and websites look better with them. In fact, the more, the merrier! </p>
<p>The problem is that loading images uses up a lot of resources and lowers your overall website performance. It’s one of those double-edge-sword kinds of situations.</p>
<p>Here’s where lazy loading saunters in. You’ve heard of it here and there. Maybe your developer friend said it was a good way to go. But you want to get cozy with the idea before doing anything too crazy with your website. </p>
<p>It’s a good thing you’re here because you’re about to get super savvy on everything you need to know about lazy loading images.</p>
<p>Let’s get started!</p>
<h2>What is lazy loading?</h2>
<p>Think about a slacking employee who only works when their boss is looking. That’s kind of what your browser does when it’s lazy loading images. It only loads the images you’re looking at and delays the rest until you scroll down to see them.</p>
<p>This sneaky technique allows the content on-screen to load much faster since the page isn’t trying to load all the content off-screen at the same time. It’s essentially loading the content into small, manageable batches.</p>
<p>You’ve probably seen lazy loading in action. It goes something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You land on a page and take a good look at the content (above the fold).</li>
<li>After a few seconds, you scroll down to nosey the rest of the page.</li>
<li>You’ll notice images start to appear as you scroll by. Sometimes there’ll be a placeholder that suddenly gets replaced by the real image.</li>
<li>You stay on the website because it’s showing you what you want to see without making you wait. Mission accomplished.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h2>What are some lazy loading examples?</h2>
<p>Lazy loading images is a pretty popular thing to do on the interwebs. If a website has a lot of images to show, then they lazy load them to save precious time and effort. It&#8217;s simply another great way to <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">optimize your website</a>. Here are a few snapshots to give you a better idea.</p>
<h3>Google Images</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3348 size-large" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/google-images-1024x513.png" alt="Screenshot of Google Images loading" width="1024" height="513" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/google-images-1024x513.png 1024w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/google-images-300x150.png 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/google-images-768x385.png 768w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/google-images-350x175.png 350w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/google-images.png 1426w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Google loads the first images quickly then loads the rest as you scroll down.</p>
<h3>Medium</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3347 size-large" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/medium-images-1024x602.png" alt="Screenshot of Medium images loading" width="1024" height="602" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/medium-images-1024x602.png 1024w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/medium-images-300x176.png 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/medium-images-768x452.png 768w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/medium-images.png 1241w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Medium uses “progressive loading” which is just a blurry version of the final image.</p>
<h3>Unsplash</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3346 size-large" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsplash-images-1024x522.png" alt="Screenshot of Unsplash images loading" width="1024" height="522" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsplash-images-1024x522.png 1024w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsplash-images-300x153.png 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsplash-images-768x391.png 768w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unsplash-images.png 1427w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Unsplash loads images as you scroll too. The grey placeholders get replaced in a split second.</p>
<h3>Pinterest</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3345 size-large" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pinterest-images-1024x527.png" alt="Screenshot of Pinterest images loading" width="1024" height="527" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pinterest-images-1024x527.png 1024w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pinterest-images-300x154.png 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pinterest-images-768x395.png 768w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pinterest-images.png 1412w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Pinterest uses colorful placeholders to snag your short attention span while the images load.</p>
<h2>What are the advantages of lazy loading?</h2>
<p>So far lazy loading seems like the bee’s knees for faster websites. But you may ask yourself, &#8220;Is it <i>really</i> that bad if I just&#8230;load things normally?&#8221; Well, there are three main advantages to lazy loading that you should think about before tossing the idea out the window.</p>
<p><b>Optimized web performance </b>This one is obvious, but it’s the main reason lazy loading became a thing in the first place. </p>
<p>When you lazy load, you’re reducing the initial load time and use of resources (server time, browser processing, etc.). This lets your webpage pounce on the screen instead of crawling its way into view. As we all know, faster = better.</p>
<p><b>Improved SEO </b>A webpage struggling to load 20 images at once is bound to be slow. And slow pages hurt your overall SEO since Google considers <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/all-you-ever-need-to-know-about-website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page speed</a> when ranking your website. </p>
<p>Plus, users <i>hate</i> waiting online and will jump ship if your page takes more than <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two seconds to load</a>. If that wasn’t bad enough, this shifty behavior makes Google think your website’s a bad apple and will rank you even lower. Farewell, web traffic.</p>
<p><b>Less data usage for mobile users </b>More than half of online browsing takes place on mobile nowadays. This means a chunk of your leads will drop you like a hot potato if your website is draining half their data (and their battery). </p>
<p>Lazy loading only uses enough resources to reveal what’s on screen, so images off-screen won’t use any at all if the user never scrolls down to them. Smart, right?</p>
<h2>But is lazy loading <b>always</b> necessary?</h2>
<p>Here’s a quick algorithm for you. Is your image-heavy website having performance issues? If yes, then consider lazy loading part of your solution. If no, then don’t worry about it. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p>
<h2>How to implement lazy loading?</h2>
<p>So you’ve finally decided you need lazy loading to improve your website performance. Congrats! You’re already a step ahead of many website owners out there.</p>
<p>There are more than a few ways to go about it, but we’ll cover the best approaches, and you can choose the right one for you (or at least get the right link to fling over to a developer).</p>
<h3>For the brave: Code it yourself</h3>
<p>If you’re a DIY kind of person, then you may want to roll up your sleeves, flex your fingers and type up a lazy loading solution in good ol’ JavaScript. </p>
<p>You can find tutorials for <a href="https://davidwalsh.name/lazyload-image-fade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simple JavaScript lazy loading</a> where images gracefully fade into view. Or you can copy Medium’s blurry pre-image method by <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-your-own-progressive-image-loader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">building your own progressive image loader</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to get fancy with colorful placeholders like you saw on the Pinterest example earlier, take a look at this guide by Manuel Wieser about <a href="https://manu.ninja/dominant-colors-for-lazy-loading-images/">dominant color placeholders for lazy loading images</a>.<br /><br/</p>
<h3>For the practical: Use a lazy loading library</h3>
<p>Even if you’re able to code it from scratch, it’s always faster if you use a library. Here’s a brief rundown of a few snazzy libraries you can use for lazy loading:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/toddmotto/echo">Echo.js</a>: Also known as the vanilla JavaScript to lazy loading images as they become visible on screen. Nothing fancy, just a job well done.</p>
<p><a href="http://dinbror.dk/blazy/+">BLazy.js</a>: Aside from having the best name, this library is slightly heavier than Echo.js, but it packs more of a punch. You can define lazy loading images for retina displays and even for specific screen sizes.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ApoorvSaxena/lozad.js">Lozad.js</a>: This one lazy loads all kinds of images and videos, even ads. It supports responsive images and backgrounds too.</p>
<h3>For the busy: Install a lazy loading WordPress plugin</h3>
<p>What better way than simply installing a plugin that will do all the work for you. Check out these top-rated lazy load plugins for WordPress websites. The best part is they’re free. We like free.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-load/">Lazy Load</a>: A no-nonsense lazy load plugin that just does the job. No customizing, no nothing.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/bj-lazy-load/">BJ Lazy Load</a>: Ignore the name for a second. This plugin gives you control over all kinds of images and even works on videos embedded from YouTube and Vimeo.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/a3-lazy-load/">A3 Lazy Load</a>: This is a popular one. It’s focused on mobile and works on both images and videos.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rocket-lazy-load/">Rocket Lazy Load:</a> One of the lightest plugins around. It does what the rest do and is also open source.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/dominant-colors-lazy-loading/">Dominant Colors Lazy Loading</a>: Remember those fancy placeholders we mentioned earlier? This plugin will add a splash of color to your page while the images are getting ready for showtime.</p>
<h2>Wait, what about lazy loading for video and audio?</h2>
<p>Aha! Want to take it a step further, do you? That’s good, and it also makes a lot of sense since videos and audio files can be way heavier than images.</p>
<p>Many of the WordPress plugins you saw a moment ago do cover lazy loading for videos, but you can also check out a dedicated plugin just for videos <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/lazy-load-for-videos/">here</a>, and a lazy loading plugin for both video and audio <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/velocity/">here</a>.<br /> Don’t say we’re not helpful.</p>
<h2>Okay, lazy loading is great, but I’m still stuck. What now?</h2>
<p>Well, my friend, if you’re still here instead of in a new tab reading a tutorial on lazy loading, then you’re most likely an innocent business owner in need of some personalized help. </p>
<p>It’s okay; your job is focusing on growing your business, not tweaking HTML. That’s what nerdy web developers like us are for.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>First of all: What is page speed?</strong></h2>
<p>In a nutshell, page speed is how long it takes for everything on a page to load. We can get into the techy details later. All you need to know now is that the faster your page loads, the better.
</p>
<p>Why, you ask? Well, it gives your customers what they want (which helps your conversions), and boosts your ranking in search results (so more customers can find you).</p>
<h3><strong>SEO Best Practices</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s the bad news: <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">Google considers page speed</a> when deciding how well you rank. This means the slower your page is, the less likely you’ll be in the top three search results. It also means users won’t stay on your site long enough to even know what you have to offer.
</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/10-reasons-website-can-high-bounce-rate/182260/">studies show</a> that if your page isn’t up and running by the time they blink, they’ll sigh and go elsewhere. That’s a red flag in Google’s eyes.
</p>
<p>Bottom line is, slow pages hurt your SEO. The good news is, you can do something about it. Here are a few starting points:</p>
<p><b>Reduce response time:</b> Response time is how long it takes for your page to show minimal signs of life when users click on a link to it. Just so you know, one <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">survey</a> revealed that nearly half of web users will jump ship after a mere <i>three</i> second delay in page response time. Scary. We know.</p>
<p><b>Speed it up on mobile: </b>In the good ol’ days, you could enjoy a pretty decent ranking even with sluggish loading times on mobile. But Google has put its mighty foot down, and now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/google-will-make-page-speed-a-factor-in-mobile-search-ranking-starting-in-july/">page speed on mobile</a> is a major factor for search ranking. This means laggy pages on mobile can seriously hurt your overall SEO. Plus, you’ll want to get on this pronto considering <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1185/mobile-commerce/">39% of online shoppers</a> are on mobile.</p>
<p><b>Check your page speed:</b> By now you’re probably wondering, “Okay, so how do I know my page speed?” That’s easy. You can run it through <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google’s PageSpeed Insights</a>. You just put in a web page URL (the link), and you get your very own speed score. It’s even nice enough to tell you what’s slowing your page down and what you can do about it. Pretty neat, right?</p>
<h2><strong>What is website speed?</strong></h2>
<p>Now this is important. Website speed is how fast your website loads overall, and it’s in your best interest to makes yours quick. With literally billions of websites clamoring for attention, users won’t hesitate to skip your slow-loading site and head off to your speedier competitor.
</p>
<p>Seem unfair? Well, think of it this way: In a room full of potential employees, would you hire the candidate who freezes up and takes five seconds before answering every question? Nope. If they’re slow now, it’s only going to be frustrating working with them later. First impressions are important.
</p>
<p>Same rules apply online. If you’re slow, you lose the dough. Capisce?</p>
<h2><strong>Why website speed matters</strong></h2>
<p>You may be kidding yourself in thinking, “But my website is seriously cool, surely they’ll wait a couple seconds longer!” No, they will not.
</p>
<p>People are impatient, especially online, and if they want something, they want it <i>now</i>.</p>
<p>But don’t take it from us, here are some cold, hard facts on why you should care about website speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites that take more than two seconds to load <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/">lose 53% of potential customers</a>.</li>
<li>Google penalizes slow websites and <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">ranks fast websites higher</a>.</li>
<li>Faster websites improve User Experience. <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">79% of shoppers</a> won’t return to a website if it was frustratingly slow the first time.</li>
<li>People want speed! On mobile, <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">85% of users</a> expect the site to load as fast or faster than on desktop.</li>
<li>A single-second delay can <a href="https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/about/news/press/2017-press/akamai-releases-spring-2017-state-of-online-retail-performance-report.jsp">reduce conversions by 7%</a>. So if you make $5,000 per day from your e-commerce site, then that one second will cost you $125,000 in lost revenue. Ouch.</li>
<li>Fun fact: Walmart reported a <a href="http://www.globaldots.com/how-website-speed-affects-conversion-rates/">2% increase in conversions</a> for every one-second improvement in their site speed.</li>
<li>Extra fun fact: Mozilla got <a href="http://www.globaldots.com/how-website-speed-affects-conversion-rates/">60 million more Firefox downloads</a> per year by making their pages a mere 2.2 seconds faster. Every second counts!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How do I speed up my website?</strong></h2>
<p>We’re glad you’ve arrived at this point, because we don’t want you leaving money on the table over a couple seconds delay. Now, hold onto your breeches while we show you how to get your website into warp speed.</p>
<h3><strong>Enable compression</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s a non-surprise for you: Your website is made of code. It’s what makes every page look just how you want it. Text here, image there, logo in the corner, etc.
</p>
<p>But code is like a suitcase. The heavier it is, the longer it’ll take you to move it. If that suitcase were, say, smaller and lighter, then you can be off and running. That’s where compression comes in.
</p>
<p>You’re going to want to make that bulky code of yours smaller, so use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/">Gzip</a>. It’s a nifty application that compresses files that are much too large. <b>Warning:</b> Don’t use it for images, unless you want them to end up looking like one giant pixel. We’ll get to how you can optimize images later.</p>
<h3><strong>Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML</strong></h3>
<p>Wait, wait. Don’t glaze over just yet, we promise to keep it simple. Let’s go back to the suitcase analogy. Making a bulky suitcase more compact is great on its own, but if you could take out the extra odds and ends that you don’t really need, then it’s going to be a whole lot lighter.
</p>
<p>That’s what minifying code does, and there are plenty of ways to do it. But Google knows best, and it <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/MinifyResources">recommends these minifying tools</a>. See? We told you it would be simple.</p>
<h3><strong>Reduce redirects</strong></h3>
<p>You know when a road is closed off and there’s that poor guy standing in the middle of traffic waving his arms around telling cars where to go?
</p>
<p>Website redirects are kind of like that guy. They automatically take users on your website to the new location of something you previously moved or deleted.</p>
<p>The problem is, like with the traffic example, they make users take longer to get to where they want to be.
</p>
<p>Check out these suggestions from Google on <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rtt#AvoidRedirects">how to avoid redirects</a>. You can also give your pages a shakedown using the <a href="https://varvy.com/tools/redirects/">redirect mapper tool</a> to know exactly which redirects you can clean up.</p>
<h3><strong>Remove render-blocking JavaScript</strong></h3>
<p>Website browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) have to process scripts of code to make things on your website load. Turns out that JavaScript is like that one guy in front of the line at Starbucks who won&#8217;t let anyone go ahead until they’re done ordering a 12-ingredient latte. So <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remove-javascript-rendering-block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check this post</a> on how you can stop that script from holding up the line.</p>
<h3><strong>Leverage browser caching</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone loves leverage. But first, what in the world is caching? A cache is where bits of website data (pages, images, files, etc.) are stored temporarily so it takes less time to load next time.
</p>
<p>Usually, caches have expiration dates so make sure yours is set to a minimum of one week or a maximum of one year. Actually, you can check when your cache expiration date is with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/YSlow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this cool tool</a>.</p>
<p><b>Bonus tip:</b> If your website is on WordPress, you can kick back and install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a> plugin to manage your cache settings.</p>
<p><strong>Extra bonus tip:</strong> We like to think we&#8217;re nice people, so we did the digging for you and wrote up a complete guide on everything you need to know about <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/how-leverage-browser-caching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">browser caching and how to leverage it</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Improve server response time</strong></h3>
<p>You may already know what a server is (hint: it’s where your website lives), but you probably didn’t know the ideal server response time is 200ms.
</p>
<p>That’s a pretty short time for your server to show a user what they want after clicking a button on your website. There are a bunch of factors that may be slowing down your server response time, but <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/support/server-response-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here are some tips</a> on how to improve it.</p>
<h3><strong>Optimize images</strong></h3>
<p>Images are great for your website, but if they’re heavy, they can really slow your loading time down. Ask your designer to optimize the images in Photoshop using the “Save for Web” feature before sending them over to you.
</p>
<p>If you’re doing this solo (all the power to you), use free tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a> or the desktop app <a href="http://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/">RIOT</a> to really slim those images down. For WordPress websites, install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/">WP Smush</a> plugin to have it all done automatically. Lucky you.</p>
<h3><strong>Don’t Rely on HTML to resize images</strong></h3>
<p>We know how it is. You have a huge image but it looks great so you upload it to your website as is. Your website then does that cool thing where it scales the image down for you. Neat, right?
</p>
<p>Not really. Your browser is essentially swallowing a watermelon to give you a seed. If you’re going to use a small image, upload the image in the size you need to shave a few seconds off your loading time. Every second counts!</p>
<h3><strong>Combine background images into sprites</strong></h3>
<p>We mean “sprites” as in a collection of images &#8211; not the sodas. Basically, a sprite takes a bunch of separate images and flattens them into just one, so your server only has to get one file instead of five or six (which would take longer). Creating a sprite isn’t hard at all. In fact, you can generate them for free <a href="http://cssspritestool.com/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/css/sprite-generator">here</a>, and <a href="https://wearekiss.com/spritepad">here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoid image hotlinking</strong></h3>
<p>Hotlinking is actually a pretty common problem. It&#8217;s when people link to your files and images but show them on their own website. This means that users can view them on that other website, but <i>your</i> server will be the one loading them up.
</p>
<p>So not only will your server be handling your own traffic, it’ll be slowed down by their traffic too. Sneaky, right? Good news is that you can protect your server from these fiendish leeches with these awesome <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/hotlinking/#plugin">tips for preventing hotlinking</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Prioritize above-the-fold content (lazy loading)</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lazy loading</a> is about as good as it sounds. When users first arrive on your website, they’re only going to be looking at the top part (i.e. Above the fold).
</p>
<p>You can get your website to show that top part a lot faster by telling it to only load the rest of the page when the user starts scrolling down. It’s a “what you see is what you get” kind of approach. This <a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload">Lazy Load plugin</a> will help you get the job done.</p>
<h3><strong>Concatenate files</strong></h3>
<p>Remember how we said you should <a>combine images into sprites</a> so the server spends less time getting multiple files? Same goes for a lot of other files.
</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is that if you have a bunch of files with similar functions (e.g. image manipulation), then it’s a good idea to concatenate them. The <a href="https://wp-rocket.me/">WP Rocket plugin</a> helps you out with this during development.</p>
<h3><strong>Reduce website plugins</strong></h3>
<p>You may have noticed we’ve been throwing out a lot of WordPress plugins. That’s because they’re a pretty simple way to get things done, but there is also the danger of installing too many of these bad boys.
</p>
<p>Every plugin takes up resources that make your website slower and heavier. So try reducing your plugins or replacing a handful of them with an “all-in-one” plugin instead.<b> Pro tip:</b> The <a href="http://wpcurve.com/wordpress-speed/"> recommended number of plugins</a> is actually 20.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoid bad requests</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine being sent to pick up an order from a restaurant only to find the restaurant doesn’t exist anymore. You’d probably walk around the block to make sure you didn’t just miss it. Then you’d end up going home empty-handed and sulking because that dead end mission just took a chunk of time out of your busy day.
</p>
<p>Your browser feels your pain. Sometimes your website links to files and images that have been deleted or moved elsewhere. Think about those dreaded “Error 404” messages. No-one likes them.
</p>
<p>Good guy <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none">Google Analytics</a> usually gives you a heads up when something is missing, but you can also run your website through a free <a href="http://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/find-broken-links.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> broken link checker</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Specify a character set</strong></h3>
<p>Long story short: machines don’t understand human-speak. They use character sets which is like a code key for them to know which numbers and letters to show us online.
</p>
<p>There are various character sets to choose from but the dominating one is called UTF-8. By declaring this to your browser, you’ll save it from searching around for one before loading a page on your website. You have to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-encoding-declarations"> specify a character set in HTML</a>, so maybe poke a developer about it to save yourself the headache.</p>
<h3><strong>Reduce DNS lookups</strong></h3>
<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it’s basically a translator for the World Wide Web. Every website has an IP address (like every person has an ID number), but no one is going to remember all those numbers, so what DNS does is take them and translate them into a friendly name, like “Google.com”.
</p>
<p>On the flip side, when you type “Google.com” into your browser, DNS translates it back into its numerical IP address so the Internet can do its thing behind the scenes. The problem is that it takes time for DNS to lookup who’s who. Before you can do anything about it, you need to know who is taking the longest. Run your website through <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/pingdom-speed-test/"> Pingdom</a> or <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/"> WebPageTest</a> to pinpoint the culprits.</p>
<h3><strong>Enable HTTP Keep-Alive</strong></h3>
<p>Okay, first you need to know what HTTP is. It’s essentially the messenger between a browser and the server where all your files and images are kept. When a user clicks to see a page, HTTP is the loyal steed who goes and asks the server for all the files.
</p>
<p>Now, every time HTTP goes and requests a file it has to open a connection. When the request is over, the connection closes. Then it has to open it all over again for the next request. It’s like having to unlock a door and then lock it again over and over. That takes up precious time.
</p>
<p>What Keep-Alive does is leave the doors unlocked while HTTP asks for a bunch of files in one go. Some websites have this already enabled, so use <a href="https://www.giftofspeed.com/check-keep-alive/"> this tool</a> to check if yours does.</p>
<h3><strong>Use HTTP2</strong></h3>
<p>Wait, first it was HTTP and now it’s HTTP2? What’s the deal? Don’t panic, this new kid on the block is just a faster and better version of the classic. With this snazzy new version you no longer have to <a> concatenate files</a> or <a> generate image sprites</a> to speed up your loading time.
</p>
<p>The best part is that if your website is already running HTTPS (check the address bar after your website loads), then you can probably start using HTTP2. You might need to have a chat with your hosting provider first though.</p>
<h3><strong>Switch to PHP7</strong></h3>
<p>Is your trusty website running on WordPress? Well, you’re in for a treat. PHP is the programming language WordPress is built on, and now you can upgrade to the all <a href="https://torquemag.io/2017/05/compelling-reasons-you-should-switch-to-php-7/"> new and improved PHP7</a>. It’s lightyears faster than older versions of PHP and it’s easier for developers to work with too. You can know right now if your website can be upgraded with this <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/"> PHP7 compatibility checker</a>.</p>
<h3>Use a PHP Accelerator</h3>
<p>Speaking of PHP, if you find that your website isn’t compatible to upgrade to the latest version then there are still ways you can make it load faster. Check out these free PHP accelerators like <a href="https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/what-is/speed-up-php-with-apc"> ACP</a>, <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/install-xcache-to-accelerate-and-optimize-php-performance/"> XCache</a>, and <a href="http://eaccelerator.net/"> eAccelerator</a>. You just can’t beat free.</p>
<h3>Activate AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)</h3>
<p>We sure love accelerating things around here. AMP is a project by Google to help you give your website a <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/">speed boost on mobile</a>. It won’t affect your ranking (yet), but it’s worth looking into since big shots like <i>Wired</i>, <i>Gizmodo</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> are already using it.</p>
<h3>Remove query strings from static resources</h3>
<p>That seems like a mouthful, but it’s not as bad as it looks. The important thing here is that query strings on static resources can slow loading times down. A static resource can be a file or an image (e.g. your logo) which will always stay the same. To remove these pesky query strings you can either be brave and tweak your theme files, or install this handy <a href="https://www.w3-edge.com/products/w3-total-cache/"> W3 Total Cache</a> plugin.</p>
<h3>Serve resources from a consistent URL</h3>
<p>As you may know, every file and image on your website is a resource, and each resource has its own URL. But sometimes you have that one cool video you want to show off in every page, but then that video gets duplicated and each version has a different URL.
</p>
<p>This means the browser has to download a “different video” every time instead of just the one. Although plugins and redirects can also be to blame for inconsistent URLs, so check out how to solve every situation right <a href="https://wpbloggingnerd.org/how-to-serve-resources-from-a-consistent-url/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a>.</p>
<h3>Optimize your database</h3>
<p>Just like your laptop, the more information your database has, the slower it’s going to work. There’s probably a lot of useless data cramping up your website’s database, so it’s a good idea to give it a clean every so often. Of course, there’s a plugin for that. Feel free to install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/"> WP-Optimize</a> to give your ol’ database some much-needed maintenance.</p>
<h3>Use a Content Distribution Network (CDN)</h3>
<p>Think of a CDN as if it were an Apple Store. They have stores all over the world to make it faster and easier for people to buy from them. It would be a royal pain if people in Holland had to travel to the U.S. for an iPhone, right?
</p>
<p>Well, same goes for your website. You’re getting hits from all over the world and you want to make it fast and easy for them to buy what you’re selling. So use CDNs to give users better access to your web content from whichever location they’re in. If you want a CDN, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"> Cloudflare</a> or <a href="https://www.maxcdn.com/"> MaxCDN</a> are pretty good places to start.</p>
<h3>Choose the right hosting plan</h3>
<p>Last but not least, there’s your hosting plan. Not everyone catches onto this, but hosting services can actually make your website faster or slower. Usually, when it comes to choosing a hosting plan, you’re looking out for your budget and not really the speed. So you may want to head back over to those hosting features and check if you’re getting the hottest deal.</p>
