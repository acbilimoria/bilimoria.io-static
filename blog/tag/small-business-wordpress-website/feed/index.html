								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your small business website running on WordPress? If yes, then you&#8217;re part of the popular crowd. According to <a href="https://wordpress.com/about/?aff=2718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent stats</a>, WordPress powers about 26% of the world wide web.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise everyone has jumped onto the WordPress train considering it&#8217;s the most powerful and versatile Content Management Systems (CMS) out there. From small travel blogs and burgeoning business websites to Fortune 500s like Sony Music and Forbes blog. WordPress is a force to be reckoned with.
</p>
<p>The problem with WordPress (and most websites) is that it&#8217;s easy to overstuff it with plugins, leave broken links unattended, and bog it down with heavy media. The good news is that all of this and all other slow-loading WordPress problems can be fixed. Quite easily, we might add.
</p>
<p>So, settle into your chair, grab a pen and get ready to learn:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Why your WordPress website is slower than a dial-up connection.</li>
<li>How to check for performance issues in just two clicks.</li>
<li>Five easy tips to kick your slow WordPress website into warp speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Reasons your WordPress website is slow</strong></h2>
<p>Slow websites are the stone in the internet&#8217;s shoe. They&#8217;re annoying and they happen more often than anyone would like.
</p>
<p>When you have a small business website that&#8217;s already struggling for attention, the last thing you need is for it to load at the speed of nothing. In fact, according to SEO guru, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neil Patel</a>, here are a few major reasons how laggy sites can sabotage your business goals.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Slower loading times equal more page abandonments. After 2-3 seconds, poof.</li>
<li>Page speed is a ranking signal at Google. The slower you load, the lower you go. </li>
<li>79% of online shoppers never return to a low-performing website.</li>
<li>Every three seconds you make a visitor wait decreases their satisfaction by 16%.</li>
<li>One second delay can result in a 7% reduction in conversions. Ouch.</li>
</ul>
<p>We won&#8217;t go into too much detail about site speed here (we already did that in our post on <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Everything You Need To Know About Web Speed</a>), so we&#8217;ll jump right into the top reasons why your website is being a right pain.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s bloated with plugins, old scripts, and unused links.</li>
<li>Your hosting provider can&#8217;t keep up with the traffic.</li>
<li>You have way too many heavy images.</li>
<li>Your website isn&#8217;t leveraging caching to load pages faster.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Feeling slightly overwhelmed already? That&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;re here to guide you through it all. Of course, if you&#8217;d rather just have us speed up your website for you so you can focus on other things (like growing your business), drop us a quick message <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>In any case, here&#8217;s how to fix all of these issues and more with a bit of research, the right tools, and some elbow grease.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>First, check how fast your site is loading</strong></h2>
<p>You won&#8217;t know how grave your situation is until you actually check your website speed. You can do this in just a couple of clicks and using tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> (free), <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/?logout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GTMetrix</a> (also free), and <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/product/page-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pingdom</a> (14-day trial).
</p>
<p><img src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Pingdom speed test tool" width="960" height="569" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3583" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test.jpg 960w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test-300x178.jpg 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test-768x455.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" />
</p>
<p>All you have to do is paste your website link and then all will be revealed. If you&#8217;re still not sure whether your website is much faster or slower than most in your industry, check <a href="https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/average-page-load-times-websites-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this page</a> to see how you compare with the current average load times. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Review your plugins</strong></h2>
<p>We know. You love WordPress plugins. The simplicity of installing an entire function on your website without needing any meddling developers is a wonderful thing. Except, every plugin you install adds another bucket of code on your website, and over time, all these scripts and stylesheets slow down your website.
</p>
<p>So what to do? Well, there&#8217;s no other way around it other than manually going through your list of installed plugins and deleting the ones you don&#8217;t <em>really</em> need. If you can replace four individual plugins with an all-in-one version, then do it. In general, 20 plugins is the recommended number for WordPress websites.
</p>
<p>Avoid having multiple plugins that do the same thing (like SEO plugins, for example), and if you have a plugin that you don&#8217;t really understand the point of, <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ask a developer</a> for advice.
</p>
<p>By the way, if you have 30-50+ plugins installed to make your WordPress website just the way you want it, then it&#8217;s very likely you could be in need of a new theme that eliminates the need for all that extra baggage. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Optimize your images</strong></h2>
<p>Images are the best and worst part of any WordPress website. They bring life to what would be a dull, text-laden site but they also weigh it down and slow down page loading times.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, images are easy to optimize. Here are a few things you can do to ensure your images aren&#8217;t bogging down your site.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize the images in Photoshop using the “Save for Web” feature. (PNGs are lighter than JPEGs.)</li>
<li>Run your images through free image optimization tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a>.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Smush</a> plugin to automatically reduce image sizes.</li>
<li>If you have an extensive image gallery on a page, try <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lazy loading them</a>.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Check for broken links and redundant redirects</strong></h2>
<p>Links that are doing nothing other than cluttering your database have no place in your new, ultra-fast WordPress website. There are plenty of free tools that will give you a list of broken links like <a href="https://www.drlinkcheck.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Link Check</a> and <a href="https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dead Link Checker</a>.
</p>
<p>As for redirects, think of these as connecting flights where the more connections you have to take the longer it&#8217;ll take you to reach your final destination. Some redirects are good, but too many will bring your page response time crashing down.
</p>
<p>Use good ol&#8217; <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed</a> to see which redirects are lowering your speed score. Another is<br />
<a href="https://varvy.com/tools/redirects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Redirect Mapper Tool</a>, that focuses on how many redirects your main website URL is putting visitors through.</p>
<p>
Once you&#8217;ve identified the culprits, you can go ahead and start deleting the redirects your website could do without.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Enable browser caching</strong></h2>
<p>Caching is a nifty technique where rarely-changed elements on your website (like your logo, background, etc.) are stored on the visitor&#8217;s computer. So the next time they visit your website, there&#8217;s no need to wait for all those things to download again. This makes your website load twice as fast since half the work has already been done.
</p>
<p>Not only does it save on bandwidth, it also provides a better experience for mobile users (which is more than <a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">52% of all online traffic</a>) – who also happen to be the most impatient.
</p>
<p>To get this magic-sounding thing working for your own WordPress website, the easiest way is to install a plugin. Yes, we know we told you to avoid bloating your website with plugins but technically you&#8217;re allowed 20 and this one is important.
</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Total Cache</a> (totally free), <a href="http://wp-rocket.me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Rocket</a> (paid, but worth it), and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/comet-cache/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comet Cache</a> (free and paid options).
</p>
<p>You can find even more tips and tools for browser caching and learn all the easy ways you can leverage it right <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/how-leverage-browser-caching/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Upgrade your hosting plan</strong></h2>
<p>&#8220;Upgrading&#8221; is not a word you want to hear when the budget is tight, but it may be the only way to get your WordPress website running at top speed.
</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve checked everything else and the need for speed still stands, then chances are you&#8217;re getting more traffic than what your poor hosting server can handle.
</p>
<p>When choosing a hosting plan, you need to make sure it can accommodate the size and expected popularity of your website. Otherwise, it&#8217;ll only sputter and struggle to load your pages and effectively frustrate all your visitors.
</p>
<p>Sometimes all it takes is forking out a little extra dough each month, but other times you need to switch to a faster and better hosting provider altogether. It sounds like a lot, we know, so we made a <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/best-web-hosting-small-business-website/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beginner&#8217;s guide to web hosting</a> so you know which option is best for your webite.    </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Need a hand with your WordPress website?</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, you&#8217;re already much savvier than most small business owners when it comes to making WordPress websites faster. But taking out the time to fix it all yourself isn&#8217;t something everybody wants to bother with.
</p>
<p>If you need to take a load off your plate and want to stop bleeding money due to your painfully slow website, send us a quick message and tell us how we can help your business run smoother.
