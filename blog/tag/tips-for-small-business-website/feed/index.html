								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the best web host starts out like every other choice. You look it up online and hope to find a clear-cut solution that fits your website like a glove. But then you find yourself faced with unfamiliar terms like &#8220;shared hosting&#8221; and &#8220;managed hosting.&#8221; Now you&#8217;re worried about whether you&#8217;re truly choosing the right option.
</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re here, chances are you&#8217;re brimming with questions. Which web host is best for your website? How can you make sure you&#8217;re getting your money&#8217;s worth? How much server space do you really need? Wait, what&#8217;s the difference between web hosting and a web domain anyway?
</p>
<p>As a small business owner, these concerns are magnified as you&#8217;re likely firing up your website on a budget. Here&#8217;s where we can help you. (You can also just <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact">contact us</a> right now if you&#8217;d rather have someone take care of it for you.)
</p>
<p>We want to make your life easier so we put together this essential guide for barely tech-savvy, small business owners looking to nab the best web hosting.
</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll give you a practical rundown of the main types of web hosting, sneaky things you should look out for, and tried and true tips to make sure you&#8217;re making the right choice. So take a deep breath, count to ten, and read on.  </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>What is web hosting?</strong></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start at the top. Web hosting is a service that lets you post your website on the internet.
</p>
<p>Think of it this way: a website is like a physical store. When people want to visit it, they look up the address (your domain) and then when they want to see something or make a purchase, they ask the clerk (your web host) to show it to them.
</p>
<p>Back into slightly more technical terms, your web host is where all your website&#8217;s files live. They&#8217;re stored on a server (or bunch of servers) which the web host dips into and sends the right files to your users&#8217; computer through their web browser.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Why is a good web host important?</strong></h2>
<p>You know the general reason why a good web host is not something that should be chosen lightly. But it&#8217;s common for website owners to overlook a few important details and only realize what they&#8217;re missing <em>after</em> they&#8217;ve typed in their credit card information.
</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s avoid you becoming one of them, shall we?
</p>
<h3><strong>1. Keeping your website online</strong></h3>
<p>If you go for the super budgeted option you found on a seedy-looking site, then your website will probably be offline more often than you&#8217;d like (which is never).
</p>
<p>Turns out lots of web hosting providers will oversell their resources and then not be able to keep up with the demand. So you&#8217;ll end up losing a lot of business when potential customers click on your website with all the hope in the world, just to find it&#8217;s offline. Talk about money down the drain.
</p>
<p>So when you&#8217;re scanning web hosting providers trying to find how they plan to keep your business up and running, look for the words &#8220;guaranteed uptime&#8221; or anything addressing their plan of action if your website ever goes offline.
</p>
<h3><strong>2. Loading your website quickly</strong></h3>
<p>In our practical guide covering <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/">all you need to know about website speed</a>, we mentioned that the ideal server response time is 200 milliseconds &#8212; which isn&#8217;t long at all.
</p>
<p>If your web hosting provider is cheap then their equipment will also be cheap. Which usually means their services will be slow and their poor server will choke up trying to assist all your website visitors simultaneously.
</p>
<p>Not to mention many web hosts set tight limits on the amount of traffic and bandwidth you can have, which only slows down your website even more and also frustrates your visitors.
</p>
<h3><strong>3. Ranking high in search results</strong></h3>
<p>SEO just follows you around like a cloud of angry bees, doesn&#8217;t it? But yes, your web host can affect your ranking if your website is slow or almost always offline.
</p>
<p>In fact, Google actually punishes websites that go down more often than is reasonable. So it&#8217;s worth spending a little more to make sure your website stays on Google&#8217;s good side.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>What are the types of web hosting services?</strong></h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s where business owners start to wring their hands. There are various types of web hosting and the right one for you depends on what you&#8217;ll be using it for. Here are your main options and when you should choose them.
</p>
<h3><strong>Shared hosting vs. Dedicated hosting</strong></h3>
<p>In a nutshell, shared hosting means you share a server with other people. It&#8217;s a bit like sharing your Wi-Fi with your neighbor, it&#8217;s slower than if you had the connection to yourself, but it&#8217;s also cheaper to pay for.
</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve probably already figured out what dedicated hosting means. Yep, you got it. It means you get a server all to yourself. You could say it&#8217;s the VIP of web hosting.
</p>
<p>Which one is best for you? Well, if you have a small website and don&#8217;t really expect a million visits per day, then you&#8217;ll do just fine on a shared server. Plus, as a new website owner, it&#8217;s good to start small then scale up when you&#8217;re ready.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you plan on having a seriously popular website (we&#8217;re talking Instagram model popular), then get that baby onto its own dedicated server for faster service and fewer limitations.
</p>
<h3><strong>Managed hosting vs. Collocated or Self-service hosting</strong></h3>
<p>Managed web hosting is a form of dedicated hosting. You pay for an entire server and have the web hosting provider take care of the complicated stuff like server setup, hardware and software maintenance, security and backups, customer support, all that good stuff.
</p>
<p>Managed web hosting is a great option for small to medium businesses who need the space but don&#8217;t have the means or the IT team to keep everything running smoothly.
</p>
<p>Collocated web hosting basically means you B.Y.O.S (Bring Your Own Server). You rent a space in a data center&#8217;s dark room of servers and pay them to keep an eye on your equipment for you. But you&#8217;re in charge of backups and all the technical software stuff. So maybe don&#8217;t choose this option if you&#8217;re not all that tech-savvy.
</p>
<p>Self-service hosting is a step further. You do it all yourself. You set up your server at home and keep your computer running all day long so your website stays online. (Just imagine the electrical bills.)
</p>
<p>Sounds simple? It&#8217;s not if you&#8217;re an innocent small business owner. You&#8217;ll be in charge of power, cooling, backups, security, software updates, the list goes on. Stay away from this option unless you really know what you&#8217;re doing.
</p>
<h3><strong>Website builder vs. WordPress web hosting</strong></h3>
<p>Have you seen those helpful sites like Wix and Squarespace where you can drag-and-drop an entire website and they take care of pretty much everything? That&#8217;s website builder hosting. It&#8217;s a simple option for small websites like an online portfolio or a blog. Nothing too complicated.
</p>
<p>WordPress web hosting sounds exactly like what you think it is. It&#8217;s where a hosting provider sets up your website based on WordPress&#8217; specific needs (security, software updates, etc.). So if you have a WordPress website, this is the option for you.
</p>
<h3><strong>Bonus: Static web hosting</strong></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s one you don&#8217;t see all that often, but it&#8217;s the cheapest one around. You see, a static website is like a poster on the internet. You just have some text and media up there that won&#8217;t change all that often. There are no fancy log ins or even a server sending your visitors any files.
</p>
<p>Why bother with a website like this? Well, say you have a restaurant and just want to put the menu up with your contact details. Or you&#8217;re hosting an event and only need a page with videos and images for people without social media to access.
</p>
<p>With static websites, there&#8217;s no Content Management System (CMS) like WordPress or Joomla involved. It&#8217;s just a simple, no-fuss website. Providers like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Amazon S3</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> are popular ways to host these static sites. Just a little something for you to consider.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>What to look for in a web host?</strong></h2>
<p>Ah, the million-dollar question (after &#8220;how to make a million dollars&#8221;). While price is always a major factor, you&#8217;ll need to look beyond your wallet when choosing the best web host for your business.
</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re hosting ten websites or a simple blog on your love of blue cheese, you should always make sure your future web host has the following essential things.
</p>
<h3><strong>24/7 support</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine your website is online and business is booming. Then suddenly, on a rainy Friday night, you get an email notification that your website is offline. You&#8217;re losing money every minute that goes by but nobody over at your web hosting provider is answering.
</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t they have a phone number!? Oh wait, is that an email from them? &#8230;And it&#8217;s an automated response saying support hours start on Monday from 9-5.
</p>
<p>This is a very common pickle to be in for many website owners. But it&#8217;s also a very avoidable one. When checking out web hosting providers, always look for their support hours and how you can contact them. If it&#8217;s only via email, there&#8217;s a good chance it&#8217;ll be slow. Look for live chat support and social media messaging to be safe.
</p>
<h3><strong>Security and backups</strong></h3>
<p>The last thing you want is to lose everything after some punk across the world decided to hack your website. Cyber attacks are getting all too common nowadays, so it&#8217;s important that your web host is prepared for them.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if your website just happens to have a bad day and fail because a) the server experienced an outage, or b) life is unfair; you&#8217;ll want to know that your web host regularly makes backups of your site so you can just put everything back the way it was.
</p>
<h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3>
<p>Can you add more than one domain? Will you get an email with your domain name to look professional? What e-commerce options do they offer? Here&#8217;s where you go nuts with the questions that are specific to the kind of website you&#8217;re looking to set up.
</p>
<p>If their plans and FAQ pages aren&#8217;t helpful, get in touch with them and get all the answers you need before pulling up your credit card.
</p>
<h3><strong>A reliable reputation</strong></h3>
<p>This is an important one. Make sure the web host is the real deal by putting on your detective hat and doing a bit of research. Look up their name and add the word &#8220;reviews&#8221; to your search to see what others are saying about it. Dive into forums and check their online feedback from around the web. (Be very aware if you can&#8217;t find much about them!)
</p>
<p>Taking a few extra minutes to check if they&#8217;re an established provider can make all the difference between a reliable service and a company that takes your money then packs up and leaves. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/hosting-reviews/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">list of reviewed hosting services</a> you might want to start with.
</p>
<h3><strong>Reasonable fees</strong></h3>
<p>We said &#8220;look beyond the price&#8221;, not ignore it completely! Lots of web hosts offer convenient web hosting plans with attractive signup prices, but some of them like to tack on sneaky fees when they renew your package a year later. So make sure you check all the prices, including future ones if you ever want an upgrade.
</p>
<p>Again, we insist, do try your best not get sucked into the cheapest provider you can find. Sometimes going cheap will end up being twice as expensive in the long run. Always go for quality over quantity. This is your business, after all.
</p>
</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Want more help setting up your website?</strong></h2>
<p>After reading this you should feel at least a teensy bit more confident about choosing the best web host for your small business. But we get it, you&#8217;re a busy person, tech-speak is boring, and you don&#8217;t really want to deal with all the fine print involved in getting everything set up.
</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating your very own small business website sure is exciting. That is until you realize everything that&#8217;s actually involved. </p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t the 90s anymore. Nowadays you can simply pick a theme and whip up a professional looking website to bring in the traffic and nail those sales.</p>
<p>We can already hear you muttering, &#8220;Yeah, but it&#8217;s easier said than done,&#8221; and you&#8217;re right. But you know what? Building a website is one of the most powerful things you can do for your business. With most of society constantly connected to the internet, putting your biz online skyrockets your exposure and brings you closer to financial freedom (or a yacht).</p>
<p>So whether you&#8217;re finally bringing your business to the 21st century or simply hoping to quit your day job, here&#8217;s a straightforward small business website checklist so you can be sure you&#8217;ve covered all your bases.</p>
<h2>Make your website SEO-friendly</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, good SEO = higher ranking in search results. </p>
<p>Essentially, the better you rank in search engines, like Google, the more exposure your business gets. While you can always hire a fancy SEO expert to really dig into it, there are a few basic things you can do yourself to lift your website off the ground.</p>
<h3>Insert keywords in titles, meta-descriptions, and tags</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t do SEO without keywords. If you already know which keywords your business is targeting then you&#8217;re miles ahead. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re just getting started you can use free tools like <a href="https://adwords.google.com/intl/en_ca/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Keyword Planner</a>, <a href="https://keywordtool.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keyword Tool</a>, and <a href="https://answerthepublic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Answer The Public</a> to see what your audience is typing.</p>
<p>Once you have a list of your top 3-5 keywords, put them in your titles, headers, links, and tags. For example, if you want your homepage to attract people searching for &#8220;disco dog collars&#8221;, use the top keywords used in dog collar web searches. </p>
<p>Pay special attention to the places that people see when deciding whether to click on your website or not. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3416 size-full" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bilimoria-tech-reviews.png" alt="screenshot of bilimoria search engine listing" width="598" height="132" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bilimoria-tech-reviews.png 598w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bilimoria-tech-reviews-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></p>
<p>Note how the keyword &#8220;Bilimoria Technologies&#8221; (that&#8217;s us) is in the blue title, the green link (URL), and the meta-description. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re running your website on WordPress, you can install nifty plugins like<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> All In One SEO Pack</a> or <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YoastSEO</a> which make sure you fill in all those important fields for every page on your website.</p>
<h3><strong>Track your traffic with Google Analytics</strong></h3>
<p>After you&#8217;ve done your SEO homework, you&#8217;re going to want to see if it&#8217;s working. There&#8217;s plenty of software available to track your web analytics, but for beginners, it&#8217;s safer to go with <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a>. (Plus it&#8217;s free.)</p>
<p>All you have to do is head over there, create an account, and then verify that your website is actually yours (and you&#8217;re not trying to spy on someone else&#8217;s). After that, you can check your dashboard to see how many people are coming in, what they&#8217;re clicking on, and where your SEO is falling flat.</p>
<h3>Fill it with clear and consistent content</h3>
<p>Content is a major driver of clicks, and the whole point of getting a website is to show people that you have what they need. The only way to do that is with good content. </p>
<p>For content that draws in eyeballs and gets fingers clicking, try to hit everything on this list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branding:</strong> Your logo should be in the top left corner and your brand name should be the first thing they read, followed by a tagline that tells them <em>exactly</em> what you offer. (Don&#8217;t say &#8220;We make quality shoes&#8221;, say &#8220;Custom-made shoes for senior citizens.&#8221; Be as specific as you can.)</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Scannability:</strong> Use short paragraphs (no more than four sentences) and bullet points whenever you can. Remember, people don&#8217;t read online, they <em>skim</em>.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Easy-to-read:</strong> Avoid the quirky lingo and unexplained acronyms. Read your content out loud to make sure it sounds like something an actual human would say in a conversation. If it sounds salesy or unnatural, cut it out.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> Use good quality images and videos to complement your text. Be careful though, these can be heavy and tend to slow down your website. (We&#8217;ll talk a bit more about that later.)</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Blog:</strong> Most companies use a blog to bring in more views. If you don&#8217;t have the time (or the money to hire someone), just focus on essential content like the homepage, about page, services, FAQ, and contact page.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Call to action:</strong> What do you want their next step to be? Do you want them to subscribe to your newsletter? Click the giant orange button to buy your product? Tell them what to do with a helpful call to action (CTA).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a small business homepage that includes all of these things:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3418 size-full" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot.png" alt="Screenshot of Topspot homepage" width="1411" height="797" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot.png 1411w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot-300x169.png 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot-768x434.png 768w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot-1024x578.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1411px) 100vw, 1411px" /></p>
<p>See? Plus, they have what we&#8217;re about to cover next.</p>
<h3>Add social media</h3>
<p>Have you noticed that search engines are showing more content from social media? That&#8217;s because social content is highly valued nowadays and it would do you good to join the movement. Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn are major social networks where you&#8217;ll want to make your presence known.</p>
<p>But hold on there, don&#8217;t just create the pages and hope people will find you. Be active on them, promote your services and add the social icons on every page of your website. (A good place to put them is in the header and/or footer since those are present on every page of your website.)</p>
<h2>Speed: Optimize your website</h2>
<p><a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website speed</a> is just as important as SEO. In fact, slow websites can <em>actually hurt</em> your SEO. To make matters worse, websites that take more than two seconds to load <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lose 53% of potential customers</a>. Harsh, but true. </p>
<p>So to keep your visitors happy and increase your chances of turning them into customers, here are a few essentials to <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">optimize your website</a>.</p>
<h3>Compress your images</h3>
<p>Remember when we said images and videos can be really heavy and slow down your site? Well, this is how you can nip that in the bud. Compressing images simply means making them smaller so your website can load them faster.</p>
<p>Unless you have a website developer doing this for you, go ahead and use free tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TinyPNG</a> or the desktop app <a href="http://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RIOT</a> to really slim those images down before adding them to your site. </p>
<p>For WordPress websites, simply install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Smush</a> plugin and it&#8217;ll take care of your images automatically.</p>
<h3>Make it mobile-friendly</h3>
<p>Fun fact: <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1185/mobile-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40% of online shoppers</a> are on mobile. This means you need to make your website fast and easy for them to access on their devices. </p>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s easy to find a website theme that&#8217;s already mobile-friendly, but once you start adding this and tweaking that, you&#8217;ll find that not everything fits perfectly on the small screen anymore.</p>
<p>Since you&#8217;re just starting out, you don&#8217;t have to worry about the effects of customization just yet (but keep it in mind). Right now, simply take extra care to choose a website theme that explicitly says it&#8217;s &#8220;responsive&#8221; or &#8220;mobile-friendly&#8221;. This way you can focus on your content without worrying if it&#8217;s going to look like a Picasso on mobile.</p>
<h3>Run it through a speed test</h3>
<p>To make sure your website is making the cut, you can copy and paste your web link into <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s PageSpeed Insights</a>. It&#8217;ll give you a score and then a bunch of advice on what needs to be improved. <br />
<strong>Fair warning:</strong> Google&#8217;s advice can get a little technical, but you can find every point explained (in plain English) in this enlightening <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website speed guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Bonus: Add a lazy loading plugin</h3>
<p>E-commerce websites tend to be very image-heavy and this can really slow things down. There&#8217;s a little trick called Lazy Loading where you can make the important images show faster. To get the scoop on this nifty tactic, head over to our <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Guide for Lazy Loading Images</a>.</p>

<h2>Design: Make it easy on the eyes</h2>
<p>Humans are instinctively drawn to beautiful things. If your website is easy on the eyes then you&#8217;ll have a leg up on all those Quasimodo-looking sites out there. Here&#8217;s how you can drastically reduce your chances of ending up with an ugly website.</p>
<h3>Start with an aesthetic theme</h3>
<p>If you stick to an attractive theme it&#8217;s pretty hard to mess it up. You don&#8217;t need to be an expert designer to make a beautiful website. Just follow the theme, use quality images, and have the common sense to not put red text on a red background.</p>
<h3><strong>Stick to 3-4 colors</strong></h3>
<p>Okay, usually themes have color pickers and here is where it can all go wrong. We get it, colors add pizzazz to any website. But there&#8217;s no need to use the entire rainbow. </p>
<p>All you really need is a white background, black/grey text, and two other colors to make a few titles and buttons stand out. That&#8217;s it. If you&#8217;re clueless at choosing colors, use this nifty <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">color theme generator</a> to find your perfect business hues.</p>
<h3>Keep it simple</h3>
<p>Resist the temptation to fill in every empty corner of your website. White space makes it look clean and uncluttered, so allow your content to breathe and don&#8217;t stuff in a billion images and ten different fonts. </p>

<h2>Need a hand setting up your website?</h2>
<p>While this small business website checklist is pretty short and sweet (if we may say so ourselves), it doesn&#8217;t cover <em>everything</em> you need to know. There&#8217;s hosting, customized features, advanced optimization &#8212; you name it. If this is your very first website it can be a lot to take in, so it doesn&#8217;t hurt if you get someone who has more experience to help you out.</p>
