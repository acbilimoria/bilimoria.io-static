								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: Google doesn&#8217;t like websites with heavy images. They slow down your website and that impacts your SEO. But if you compress your images to speed up your website, their quality will plummet and then your <em>users</em> won&#8217;t like them. So your users bounce and, well, that impacts your SEO.</p>
<p>Optimizing your images can be a double-edged sword, but it&#8217;s also one of the most important things you can do for your website. From making them smaller and quicker to load to adding captions for SEO, optimizing your images is easy to do and doesn&#8217;t need much tech know-how.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re about to learn the simple techniques to shrink your images, hold their quality, and keep both Google <em>and</em> your users happy. Yep, all in less than three minutes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll find in this post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why optimizing your images can make or break your SEO ranking.</li>
<li>What alt texts are and how to use them for better SEO (and accessibility).</li>
<li>How to choose the best file format for your images.</li>
<li>The simple rule for perfectly sized web images.</li>
<li>Quick tips to ensure your images always appear on Google.</li>
<li>WordPress plugins that can optimize your images in seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to kick bad SEO to the curb? Let&#8217;s get started.</p>
<h2>Why you should optimize your images</h2>
<p>On average, <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images#bytesImg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">images make up over 50%</a> of a total webpage’s weight. If they&#8217;re not optimized, more than half of your website will drag down your page speed and ranking.</p>
<p>Optimizing your images is good for business, not just for SEO but also for the user experience. Here&#8217;s a quick peek of the main benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your pages will load faster which will keep today&#8217;s impatient users on your website longer. They&#8217;ll leave if loading times exceed 2-3 seconds, so every second counts. Check our post on <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to speed up your website</a> for more tips.</li>
<li>Your images will be crawled and indexed by Google so they&#8217;ll appear in search results for users to find. This means more traffic for your site which in turn bumps up your SEO ranking.</li>
<li>Your website will take up less storage space on your server. This is great news if you have a limited web hosting plan. (Check our <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/best-web-hosting-small-business-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beginners guide to web hosting</a> for help on choosing the right host for you.)</li>
<li>Smaller image sizes use less bandwidth, something your mobile users will greatly appreciate. Not to mention Google is big on mobile and if your site doesn&#8217;t work well on the small screen, you&#8217;ll be punished with a lower SEO score.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alt texts and how to use them correctly</h2>
<p>Alternative text is that field you always see beneath an image (no, not the caption. After that).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3605" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alt-text-field-in-wordpress.png" alt="screenshot of alt text field in WordPress" width="280" height="494" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alt-text-field-in-wordpress.png 280w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/alt-text-field-in-wordpress-170x300.png 170w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></p>
<p>People either ignore this field completely or stuff it with keywords. But the primary use of alt texts is to give an image description for users who are blind or have low vision.</p>
<p>You see, these users tend to have screen readers that read everything on the website out loud. So if your images don&#8217;t have alt texts, these users simply won&#8217;t know what the image is about.</p>
<p>From an SEO perspective, the alt text serves as an opportunity for search engines to capture keywords in your content. The main thing to remember is to keep alt texts brief and as descriptive and specific as possible.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a good vs bad alt text by <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/image-alt-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubspot</a>. Take a look at the following image:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3606" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Alt-text-example.png" alt="Woman pointing to female student's computer screen in class" width="501" height="332" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Alt-text-example.png 501w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Alt-text-example-300x199.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p>In their article, Hubspot describes the case of this image being used in a webpage promoting a business school. In this scenario, you&#8217;d want the alt text to include keywords relevant to business schools while also being descriptive enough to form a mental image in people&#8217;s minds.</p>
<p>Bad alt text would go something like, &#8220;Woman pointing to someone&#8217;s computer screen.&#8221; Whereas good alt text would read, &#8220;Business school professor pointing to female student&#8217;s computer screen in class.&#8221;</p>
<p>See how that works?</p>
<h2>Best file formats for your images</h2>
<p>The format you choose for your images can make a world of difference in terms of size and quality. You know about JPEG, PNG, and GIF – but do you know when to use each one for web? We&#8217;ve got you.</p>
<h3><strong>JPEG</strong></h3>
<p>JPEG is arguably the most popular image file format on the web, and for good reason. It&#8217;s ideal for photographs and intensely colorful images, like products and homepage banners.</p>
<p>You can hardly go wrong with JPEG, but there is a small catch. JPEG has two optimization modes: lossy and lossless. Lossy means that your image will be reduced by permanently deleting some information, which in turn degrades the image quality.</p>
<p>With lossy, the more you compress the image, the lower the quality will be. Check the grey area in the images below (courtesy of <a href="https://optimus.keycdn.com/support/lossy-vs-lossless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimus</a>) to see what we mean.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3603" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossy-image-optimization.png" alt="Series of images showing result of lossy compression" width="663" height="189" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossy-image-optimization.png 663w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossy-image-optimization-300x86.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px" /></p>
<p>On the other hand, lossless, as the name suggests, shrinks the image size but doesn&#8217;t delete any information – so the quality stays the same. Granted, the image won&#8217;t get as small as with lossy, but it&#8217;ll look much better to the trained eye.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3604" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossless-image.png" alt="Two images showing results of lossless compression" width="452" height="190" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossless-image.png 452w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Example-lossless-image-300x126.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px" /></p>
<h3><strong>PNG</strong></h3>
<p>The main thing you need to know about PNG is that it&#8217;s the best format for high-quality images that have transparent layers. If your image has overlays or a transparent background, save it in PNG.</p>
<p>Where PNG is concerned, there&#8217;s PNG-8 and PNG-24. We won&#8217;t get into the technical details, but the higher the number the more colors it can handle. If you&#8217;ve got a logo with two colors in it, go ahead and save space with PNG-8. If you have a complex image or photo, go for PNG-24 so your image doesn&#8217;t end up looking like an 80s video game graphic.</p>
<h3><strong>GIF</strong></h3>
<p>You know what GIFs are, but you&#8217;d be surprised at how many website owners save their product images and logos in GIF under the impression it&#8217;s &#8220;better&#8221;.</p>
<p>Look, if your logo is simple and PNG is still too heavy, then go ahead and save it as a GIF. But for all that is good do <em>not</em> use GIF for product images. They&#8217;ll make your users think they need glasses to see them clearly.</p>
<h2>The best size for web images</h2>
<p>Honestly, there&#8217;s no one size to rule them all. But webmasters generally agree that image dimensions should be anywhere between 1500 &#8211; 2500 px wide. It&#8217;s big enough to maintain the quality, but not so big it&#8217;ll weigh your page down.</p>
<p>As for the size, when in doubt follow the &#8220;200 KB rule,&#8221; which essentially means all your images will be a lot less troublesome if they&#8217;re under 200 KB.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have Photoshop to whittle your images down to size, try any of these free image optimization tools.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gimp</a> (basically a free Photoshop)</li>
<li><a href="https://tinyjpg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TinyJPG</a> or <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TinyPNG</a></li>
<li><a href="https://kraken.io/web-interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kraken</a></li>

<li><a href="https://compressor.io/compress" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compressor.io</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>How to get your images on Google</h2>
<p>Have you ever Googled your product or service and wondered why it&#8217;s not appearing in Google Images? If you already added alt texts and your images still aren&#8217;t showing, here are a few more things you can do to catch Google&#8217;s attention.</p>
<h3><strong>Name images in plain English</strong></h3>
<p>Unless you know people who type &#8220;image10382365746.png&#8221; in the search bar, your images shouldn&#8217;t be named like that.</p>
<p>Giving your images a proper name that includes your top keywords is a great way to add extra SEO points to your website. Here&#8217;s a short list of tips for naming your images for SEO.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Keep the name to five words or fewer. Google doesn&#8217;t like novels in image names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Use hyphens to separate the words so they&#8217;re clearer to both Google and people. (E.g. &#8220;website-developer-portland&#8221; rather than &#8220;websitedeveloperportland&#8221;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Add keywords but don&#8217;t stuff them all in if they&#8217;re not relevant to the image. Say &#8220;website-developer-oregon&#8221; not &#8220;best-website-developer-oregon-java-css-hosting-free-consultation&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make it descriptive enough for anyone to get the gist of what the image is about without having to look at it. Try reading the name out loud to someone as a test.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Add captions to every image</strong></h3>
<p>An empty caption is a missed SEO opportunity. Google crawls captions too so if anyone searches for a keyword that happens to be in one of your captions, they&#8217;ll find your website.</p>
<p>Captions are also helpful little things for users to understand your content better. According to <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/shocking-truth-about-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KissMetrics</a>, captions under images are read 300% more often than the rest of the website.</p>
<p>Writing a good caption is a lot like writing a good image name. Keep it clear and to the point so your users can understand the context of the image. For example, if you have a photo of a sunset, a good caption would be: Sunset on Palm Beach, Florida.</p>
<h3><strong>Generate an image site map</strong></h3>
<p>This one needs a bit more tech-know-how, but it&#8217;s a good way to increase your chances of getting your images found.</p>
<p>If your website is using flashy pop-ups or fancy Javascript image galleries, those images might not get picked up by Google. To help the Google bots find and crawl these images, you can create an image sitemap using generator scripts like <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/images-sitemap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a>. (You can always more information on <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Webmaster Tools</a>).</p>
<h2>WordPress plugins to optimize your images</h2>
<p>Ah, WordPress plugins. There&#8217;s no better way to spare yourself from the troubles of image optimization than installing a plugin. So here&#8217;s a list of the top WordPress plugins for the job.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/imagify/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imagify</a>: For bulk optimization and three levels of compression, this plugin is the way to go. It also has a restore feature if you&#8217;re not happy with the final image. More importantly, there&#8217;s a free version you can use.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Smush</a>: This plugin takes all the images you&#8217;ve uploaded and, well, smushes them down to size. It can do it in bulk or manually if you want. And yes, they have a free plan too.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ewww-image-optimizer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EWWW Image Optimizer</a>: There&#8217;s nothing disgusting about this popular plugin. It&#8217;s easy to use and automatically shrinks your images as soon as you upload them. You don&#8217;t even need to create an account to use it.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/resmushit-image-optimizer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reSmush.it</a>: This one is currently the top-rated WordPress plugin for image optimization. It smushes images automatically and offers a bulk option too. The downside is it limits your uploads to 5MB in size. (Still good for a free plugin though.)</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>First of all: What is page speed?</strong></h2>
<p>In a nutshell, page speed is how long it takes for everything on a page to load. We can get into the techy details later. All you need to know now is that the faster your page loads, the better.
</p>
<p>Why, you ask? Well, it gives your customers what they want (which helps your conversions), and boosts your ranking in search results (so more customers can find you).</p>
<h3><strong>SEO Best Practices</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s the bad news: <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">Google considers page speed</a> when deciding how well you rank. This means the slower your page is, the less likely you’ll be in the top three search results. It also means users won’t stay on your site long enough to even know what you have to offer.
</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/10-reasons-website-can-high-bounce-rate/182260/">studies show</a> that if your page isn’t up and running by the time they blink, they’ll sigh and go elsewhere. That’s a red flag in Google’s eyes.
</p>
<p>Bottom line is, slow pages hurt your SEO. The good news is, you can do something about it. Here are a few starting points:</p>
<p><b>Reduce response time:</b> Response time is how long it takes for your page to show minimal signs of life when users click on a link to it. Just so you know, one <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">survey</a> revealed that nearly half of web users will jump ship after a mere <i>three</i> second delay in page response time. Scary. We know.</p>
<p><b>Speed it up on mobile: </b>In the good ol’ days, you could enjoy a pretty decent ranking even with sluggish loading times on mobile. But Google has put its mighty foot down, and now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/google-will-make-page-speed-a-factor-in-mobile-search-ranking-starting-in-july/">page speed on mobile</a> is a major factor for search ranking. This means laggy pages on mobile can seriously hurt your overall SEO. Plus, you’ll want to get on this pronto considering <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1185/mobile-commerce/">39% of online shoppers</a> are on mobile.</p>
<p><b>Check your page speed:</b> By now you’re probably wondering, “Okay, so how do I know my page speed?” That’s easy. You can run it through <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google’s PageSpeed Insights</a>. You just put in a web page URL (the link), and you get your very own speed score. It’s even nice enough to tell you what’s slowing your page down and what you can do about it. Pretty neat, right?</p>
<h2><strong>What is website speed?</strong></h2>
<p>Now this is important. Website speed is how fast your website loads overall, and it’s in your best interest to makes yours quick. With literally billions of websites clamoring for attention, users won’t hesitate to skip your slow-loading site and head off to your speedier competitor.
</p>
<p>Seem unfair? Well, think of it this way: In a room full of potential employees, would you hire the candidate who freezes up and takes five seconds before answering every question? Nope. If they’re slow now, it’s only going to be frustrating working with them later. First impressions are important.
</p>
<p>Same rules apply online. If you’re slow, you lose the dough. Capisce?</p>
<h2><strong>Why website speed matters</strong></h2>
<p>You may be kidding yourself in thinking, “But my website is seriously cool, surely they’ll wait a couple seconds longer!” No, they will not.
</p>
<p>People are impatient, especially online, and if they want something, they want it <i>now</i>.</p>
<p>But don’t take it from us, here are some cold, hard facts on why you should care about website speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites that take more than two seconds to load <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/">lose 53% of potential customers</a>.</li>
<li>Google penalizes slow websites and <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">ranks fast websites higher</a>.</li>
<li>Faster websites improve User Experience. <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">79% of shoppers</a> won’t return to a website if it was frustratingly slow the first time.</li>
<li>People want speed! On mobile, <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">85% of users</a> expect the site to load as fast or faster than on desktop.</li>
<li>A single-second delay can <a href="https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/about/news/press/2017-press/akamai-releases-spring-2017-state-of-online-retail-performance-report.jsp">reduce conversions by 7%</a>. So if you make $5,000 per day from your e-commerce site, then that one second will cost you $125,000 in lost revenue. Ouch.</li>
<li>Fun fact: Walmart reported a <a href="http://www.globaldots.com/how-website-speed-affects-conversion-rates/">2% increase in conversions</a> for every one-second improvement in their site speed.</li>
<li>Extra fun fact: Mozilla got <a href="http://www.globaldots.com/how-website-speed-affects-conversion-rates/">60 million more Firefox downloads</a> per year by making their pages a mere 2.2 seconds faster. Every second counts!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How do I speed up my website?</strong></h2>
<p>We’re glad you’ve arrived at this point, because we don’t want you leaving money on the table over a couple seconds delay. Now, hold onto your breeches while we show you how to get your website into warp speed.</p>
<h3><strong>Enable compression</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s a non-surprise for you: Your website is made of code. It’s what makes every page look just how you want it. Text here, image there, logo in the corner, etc.
</p>
<p>But code is like a suitcase. The heavier it is, the longer it’ll take you to move it. If that suitcase were, say, smaller and lighter, then you can be off and running. That’s where compression comes in.
</p>
<p>You’re going to want to make that bulky code of yours smaller, so use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/">Gzip</a>. It’s a nifty application that compresses files that are much too large. <b>Warning:</b> Don’t use it for images, unless you want them to end up looking like one giant pixel. We’ll get to how you can optimize images later.</p>
<h3><strong>Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML</strong></h3>
<p>Wait, wait. Don’t glaze over just yet, we promise to keep it simple. Let’s go back to the suitcase analogy. Making a bulky suitcase more compact is great on its own, but if you could take out the extra odds and ends that you don’t really need, then it’s going to be a whole lot lighter.
</p>
<p>That’s what minifying code does, and there are plenty of ways to do it. But Google knows best, and it <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/MinifyResources">recommends these minifying tools</a>. See? We told you it would be simple.</p>
<h3><strong>Reduce redirects</strong></h3>
<p>You know when a road is closed off and there’s that poor guy standing in the middle of traffic waving his arms around telling cars where to go?
</p>
<p>Website redirects are kind of like that guy. They automatically take users on your website to the new location of something you previously moved or deleted.</p>
<p>The problem is, like with the traffic example, they make users take longer to get to where they want to be.
</p>
<p>Check out these suggestions from Google on <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rtt#AvoidRedirects">how to avoid redirects</a>. You can also give your pages a shakedown using the <a href="https://varvy.com/tools/redirects/">redirect mapper tool</a> to know exactly which redirects you can clean up.</p>
<h3><strong>Remove render-blocking JavaScript</strong></h3>
<p>Website browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) have to process scripts of code to make things on your website load. Turns out that JavaScript is like that one guy in front of the line at Starbucks who won&#8217;t let anyone go ahead until they’re done ordering a 12-ingredient latte. So <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remove-javascript-rendering-block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check this post</a> on how you can stop that script from holding up the line.</p>
<h3><strong>Leverage browser caching</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone loves leverage. But first, what in the world is caching? A cache is where bits of website data (pages, images, files, etc.) are stored temporarily so it takes less time to load next time.
</p>
<p>Usually, caches have expiration dates so make sure yours is set to a minimum of one week or a maximum of one year. Actually, you can check when your cache expiration date is with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/YSlow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this cool tool</a>.</p>
<p><b>Bonus tip:</b> If your website is on WordPress, you can kick back and install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a> plugin to manage your cache settings.</p>
<p><strong>Extra bonus tip:</strong> We like to think we&#8217;re nice people, so we did the digging for you and wrote up a complete guide on everything you need to know about <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/how-leverage-browser-caching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">browser caching and how to leverage it</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Improve server response time</strong></h3>
<p>You may already know what a server is (hint: it’s where your website lives), but you probably didn’t know the ideal server response time is 200ms.
</p>
<p>That’s a pretty short time for your server to show a user what they want after clicking a button on your website. There are a bunch of factors that may be slowing down your server response time, but <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/support/server-response-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here are some tips</a> on how to improve it.</p>
<h3><strong>Optimize images</strong></h3>
<p>Images are great for your website, but if they’re heavy, they can really slow your loading time down. Ask your designer to optimize the images in Photoshop using the “Save for Web” feature before sending them over to you.
</p>
<p>If you’re doing this solo (all the power to you), use free tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a> or the desktop app <a href="http://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/">RIOT</a> to really slim those images down. For WordPress websites, install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/">WP Smush</a> plugin to have it all done automatically. Lucky you.</p>
<h3><strong>Don’t Rely on HTML to resize images</strong></h3>
<p>We know how it is. You have a huge image but it looks great so you upload it to your website as is. Your website then does that cool thing where it scales the image down for you. Neat, right?
</p>
<p>Not really. Your browser is essentially swallowing a watermelon to give you a seed. If you’re going to use a small image, upload the image in the size you need to shave a few seconds off your loading time. Every second counts!</p>
<h3><strong>Combine background images into sprites</strong></h3>
<p>We mean “sprites” as in a collection of images &#8211; not the sodas. Basically, a sprite takes a bunch of separate images and flattens them into just one, so your server only has to get one file instead of five or six (which would take longer). Creating a sprite isn’t hard at all. In fact, you can generate them for free <a href="http://cssspritestool.com/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/css/sprite-generator">here</a>, and <a href="https://wearekiss.com/spritepad">here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoid image hotlinking</strong></h3>
<p>Hotlinking is actually a pretty common problem. It&#8217;s when people link to your files and images but show them on their own website. This means that users can view them on that other website, but <i>your</i> server will be the one loading them up.
</p>
<p>So not only will your server be handling your own traffic, it’ll be slowed down by their traffic too. Sneaky, right? Good news is that you can protect your server from these fiendish leeches with these awesome <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/hotlinking/#plugin">tips for preventing hotlinking</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Prioritize above-the-fold content (lazy loading)</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lazy loading</a> is about as good as it sounds. When users first arrive on your website, they’re only going to be looking at the top part (i.e. Above the fold).
</p>
<p>You can get your website to show that top part a lot faster by telling it to only load the rest of the page when the user starts scrolling down. It’s a “what you see is what you get” kind of approach. This <a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload">Lazy Load plugin</a> will help you get the job done.</p>
<h3><strong>Concatenate files</strong></h3>
<p>Remember how we said you should <a>combine images into sprites</a> so the server spends less time getting multiple files? Same goes for a lot of other files.
</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is that if you have a bunch of files with similar functions (e.g. image manipulation), then it’s a good idea to concatenate them. The <a href="https://wp-rocket.me/">WP Rocket plugin</a> helps you out with this during development.</p>
<h3><strong>Reduce website plugins</strong></h3>
<p>You may have noticed we’ve been throwing out a lot of WordPress plugins. That’s because they’re a pretty simple way to get things done, but there is also the danger of installing too many of these bad boys.
</p>
<p>Every plugin takes up resources that make your website slower and heavier. So try reducing your plugins or replacing a handful of them with an “all-in-one” plugin instead.<b> Pro tip:</b> The <a href="http://wpcurve.com/wordpress-speed/"> recommended number of plugins</a> is actually 20.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoid bad requests</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine being sent to pick up an order from a restaurant only to find the restaurant doesn’t exist anymore. You’d probably walk around the block to make sure you didn’t just miss it. Then you’d end up going home empty-handed and sulking because that dead end mission just took a chunk of time out of your busy day.
</p>
<p>Your browser feels your pain. Sometimes your website links to files and images that have been deleted or moved elsewhere. Think about those dreaded “Error 404” messages. No-one likes them.
</p>
<p>Good guy <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none">Google Analytics</a> usually gives you a heads up when something is missing, but you can also run your website through a free <a href="http://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/find-broken-links.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> broken link checker</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Specify a character set</strong></h3>
<p>Long story short: machines don’t understand human-speak. They use character sets which is like a code key for them to know which numbers and letters to show us online.
</p>
<p>There are various character sets to choose from but the dominating one is called UTF-8. By declaring this to your browser, you’ll save it from searching around for one before loading a page on your website. You have to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-encoding-declarations"> specify a character set in HTML</a>, so maybe poke a developer about it to save yourself the headache.</p>
<h3><strong>Reduce DNS lookups</strong></h3>
<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it’s basically a translator for the World Wide Web. Every website has an IP address (like every person has an ID number), but no one is going to remember all those numbers, so what DNS does is take them and translate them into a friendly name, like “Google.com”.
</p>
<p>On the flip side, when you type “Google.com” into your browser, DNS translates it back into its numerical IP address so the Internet can do its thing behind the scenes. The problem is that it takes time for DNS to lookup who’s who. Before you can do anything about it, you need to know who is taking the longest. Run your website through <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/pingdom-speed-test/"> Pingdom</a> or <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/"> WebPageTest</a> to pinpoint the culprits.</p>
<h3><strong>Enable HTTP Keep-Alive</strong></h3>
<p>Okay, first you need to know what HTTP is. It’s essentially the messenger between a browser and the server where all your files and images are kept. When a user clicks to see a page, HTTP is the loyal steed who goes and asks the server for all the files.
</p>
<p>Now, every time HTTP goes and requests a file it has to open a connection. When the request is over, the connection closes. Then it has to open it all over again for the next request. It’s like having to unlock a door and then lock it again over and over. That takes up precious time.
</p>
<p>What Keep-Alive does is leave the doors unlocked while HTTP asks for a bunch of files in one go. Some websites have this already enabled, so use <a href="https://www.giftofspeed.com/check-keep-alive/"> this tool</a> to check if yours does.</p>
<h3><strong>Use HTTP2</strong></h3>
<p>Wait, first it was HTTP and now it’s HTTP2? What’s the deal? Don’t panic, this new kid on the block is just a faster and better version of the classic. With this snazzy new version you no longer have to <a> concatenate files</a> or <a> generate image sprites</a> to speed up your loading time.
</p>
<p>The best part is that if your website is already running HTTPS (check the address bar after your website loads), then you can probably start using HTTP2. You might need to have a chat with your hosting provider first though.</p>
<h3><strong>Switch to PHP7</strong></h3>
<p>Is your trusty website running on WordPress? Well, you’re in for a treat. PHP is the programming language WordPress is built on, and now you can upgrade to the all <a href="https://torquemag.io/2017/05/compelling-reasons-you-should-switch-to-php-7/"> new and improved PHP7</a>. It’s lightyears faster than older versions of PHP and it’s easier for developers to work with too. You can know right now if your website can be upgraded with this <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/"> PHP7 compatibility checker</a>.</p>
<h3>Use a PHP Accelerator</h3>
<p>Speaking of PHP, if you find that your website isn’t compatible to upgrade to the latest version then there are still ways you can make it load faster. Check out these free PHP accelerators like <a href="https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/what-is/speed-up-php-with-apc"> ACP</a>, <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/install-xcache-to-accelerate-and-optimize-php-performance/"> XCache</a>, and <a href="http://eaccelerator.net/"> eAccelerator</a>. You just can’t beat free.</p>
<h3>Activate AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)</h3>
<p>We sure love accelerating things around here. AMP is a project by Google to help you give your website a <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/">speed boost on mobile</a>. It won’t affect your ranking (yet), but it’s worth looking into since big shots like <i>Wired</i>, <i>Gizmodo</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> are already using it.</p>
<h3>Remove query strings from static resources</h3>
<p>That seems like a mouthful, but it’s not as bad as it looks. The important thing here is that query strings on static resources can slow loading times down. A static resource can be a file or an image (e.g. your logo) which will always stay the same. To remove these pesky query strings you can either be brave and tweak your theme files, or install this handy <a href="https://www.w3-edge.com/products/w3-total-cache/"> W3 Total Cache</a> plugin.</p>
<h3>Serve resources from a consistent URL</h3>
<p>As you may know, every file and image on your website is a resource, and each resource has its own URL. But sometimes you have that one cool video you want to show off in every page, but then that video gets duplicated and each version has a different URL.
</p>
<p>This means the browser has to download a “different video” every time instead of just the one. Although plugins and redirects can also be to blame for inconsistent URLs, so check out how to solve every situation right <a href="https://wpbloggingnerd.org/how-to-serve-resources-from-a-consistent-url/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a>.</p>
<h3>Optimize your database</h3>
<p>Just like your laptop, the more information your database has, the slower it’s going to work. There’s probably a lot of useless data cramping up your website’s database, so it’s a good idea to give it a clean every so often. Of course, there’s a plugin for that. Feel free to install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/"> WP-Optimize</a> to give your ol’ database some much-needed maintenance.</p>
<h3>Use a Content Distribution Network (CDN)</h3>
<p>Think of a CDN as if it were an Apple Store. They have stores all over the world to make it faster and easier for people to buy from them. It would be a royal pain if people in Holland had to travel to the U.S. for an iPhone, right?
</p>
<p>Well, same goes for your website. You’re getting hits from all over the world and you want to make it fast and easy for them to buy what you’re selling. So use CDNs to give users better access to your web content from whichever location they’re in. If you want a CDN, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"> Cloudflare</a> or <a href="https://www.maxcdn.com/"> MaxCDN</a> are pretty good places to start.</p>
<h3>Choose the right hosting plan</h3>
<p>Last but not least, there’s your hosting plan. Not everyone catches onto this, but hosting services can actually make your website faster or slower. Usually, when it comes to choosing a hosting plan, you’re looking out for your budget and not really the speed. So you may want to head back over to those hosting features and check if you’re getting the hottest deal.</p>
<h2><b>One more thing</b></h2>
<p>Since websites are awesome but also extremely complicated, it’s always a good idea to have a professional tweak your website for you. They’re also handy to help you figure out how and where to begin &#8211; because let’s face it, there’s a lot to be done! Right now, we’re offering a free consultation for a <i>very</i> limited time.
