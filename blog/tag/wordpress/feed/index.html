								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your small business website running on WordPress? If yes, then you&#8217;re part of the popular crowd. According to <a href="https://wordpress.com/about/?aff=2718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent stats</a>, WordPress powers about 26% of the world wide web.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise everyone has jumped onto the WordPress train considering it&#8217;s the most powerful and versatile Content Management Systems (CMS) out there. From small travel blogs and burgeoning business websites to Fortune 500s like Sony Music and Forbes blog. WordPress is a force to be reckoned with.
</p>
<p>The problem with WordPress (and most websites) is that it&#8217;s easy to overstuff it with plugins, leave broken links unattended, and bog it down with heavy media. The good news is that all of this and all other slow-loading WordPress problems can be fixed. Quite easily, we might add.
</p>
<p>So, settle into your chair, grab a pen and get ready to learn:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Why your WordPress website is slower than a dial-up connection.</li>
<li>How to check for performance issues in just two clicks.</li>
<li>Five easy tips to kick your slow WordPress website into warp speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Reasons your WordPress website is slow</strong></h2>
<p>Slow websites are the stone in the internet&#8217;s shoe. They&#8217;re annoying and they happen more often than anyone would like.
</p>
<p>When you have a small business website that&#8217;s already struggling for attention, the last thing you need is for it to load at the speed of nothing. In fact, according to SEO guru, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neil Patel</a>, here are a few major reasons how laggy sites can sabotage your business goals.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Slower loading times equal more page abandonments. After 2-3 seconds, poof.</li>
<li>Page speed is a ranking signal at Google. The slower you load, the lower you go. </li>
<li>79% of online shoppers never return to a low-performing website.</li>
<li>Every three seconds you make a visitor wait decreases their satisfaction by 16%.</li>
<li>One second delay can result in a 7% reduction in conversions. Ouch.</li>
</ul>
<p>We won&#8217;t go into too much detail about site speed here (we already did that in our post on <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Everything You Need To Know About Web Speed</a>), so we&#8217;ll jump right into the top reasons why your website is being a right pain.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s bloated with plugins, old scripts, and unused links.</li>
<li>Your hosting provider can&#8217;t keep up with the traffic.</li>
<li>You have way too many heavy images.</li>
<li>Your website isn&#8217;t leveraging caching to load pages faster.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Feeling slightly overwhelmed already? That&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;re here to guide you through it all. Of course, if you&#8217;d rather just have us speed up your website for you so you can focus on other things (like growing your business), drop us a quick message <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>In any case, here&#8217;s how to fix all of these issues and more with a bit of research, the right tools, and some elbow grease.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>First, check how fast your site is loading</strong></h2>
<p>You won&#8217;t know how grave your situation is until you actually check your website speed. You can do this in just a couple of clicks and using tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> (free), <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/?logout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GTMetrix</a> (also free), and <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/product/page-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pingdom</a> (14-day trial).
</p>
<p><img src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Pingdom speed test tool" width="960" height="569" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3583" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test.jpg 960w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test-300x178.jpg 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test-768x455.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" />
</p>
<p>All you have to do is paste your website link and then all will be revealed. If you&#8217;re still not sure whether your website is much faster or slower than most in your industry, check <a href="https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/average-page-load-times-websites-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this page</a> to see how you compare with the current average load times. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Review your plugins</strong></h2>
<p>We know. You love WordPress plugins. The simplicity of installing an entire function on your website without needing any meddling developers is a wonderful thing. Except, every plugin you install adds another bucket of code on your website, and over time, all these scripts and stylesheets slow down your website.
</p>
<p>So what to do? Well, there&#8217;s no other way around it other than manually going through your list of installed plugins and deleting the ones you don&#8217;t <em>really</em> need. If you can replace four individual plugins with an all-in-one version, then do it. In general, 20 plugins is the recommended number for WordPress websites.
</p>
<p>Avoid having multiple plugins that do the same thing (like SEO plugins, for example), and if you have a plugin that you don&#8217;t really understand the point of, <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ask a developer</a> for advice.
</p>
<p>By the way, if you have 30-50+ plugins installed to make your WordPress website just the way you want it, then it&#8217;s very likely you could be in need of a new theme that eliminates the need for all that extra baggage. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Optimize your images</strong></h2>
<p>Images are the best and worst part of any WordPress website. They bring life to what would be a dull, text-laden site but they also weigh it down and slow down page loading times.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, images are easy to optimize. Here are a few things you can do to ensure your images aren&#8217;t bogging down your site.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize the images in Photoshop using the “Save for Web” feature. (PNGs are lighter than JPEGs.)</li>
<li>Run your images through free image optimization tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a>.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Smush</a> plugin to automatically reduce image sizes.</li>
<li>If you have an extensive image gallery on a page, try <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lazy loading them</a>.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Check for broken links and redundant redirects</strong></h2>
<p>Links that are doing nothing other than cluttering your database have no place in your new, ultra-fast WordPress website. There are plenty of free tools that will give you a list of broken links like <a href="https://www.drlinkcheck.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Link Check</a> and <a href="https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dead Link Checker</a>.
</p>
<p>As for redirects, think of these as connecting flights where the more connections you have to take the longer it&#8217;ll take you to reach your final destination. Some redirects are good, but too many will bring your page response time crashing down.
</p>
<p>Use good ol&#8217; <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed</a> to see which redirects are lowering your speed score. Another is<br />
<a href="https://varvy.com/tools/redirects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Redirect Mapper Tool</a>, that focuses on how many redirects your main website URL is putting visitors through.</p>
<p>
Once you&#8217;ve identified the culprits, you can go ahead and start deleting the redirects your website could do without.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Enable browser caching</strong></h2>
<p>Caching is a nifty technique where rarely-changed elements on your website (like your logo, background, etc.) are stored on the visitor&#8217;s computer. So the next time they visit your website, there&#8217;s no need to wait for all those things to download again. This makes your website load twice as fast since half the work has already been done.
</p>
<p>Not only does it save on bandwidth, it also provides a better experience for mobile users (which is more than <a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">52% of all online traffic</a>) – who also happen to be the most impatient.
</p>
<p>To get this magic-sounding thing working for your own WordPress website, the easiest way is to install a plugin. Yes, we know we told you to avoid bloating your website with plugins but technically you&#8217;re allowed 20 and this one is important.
</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Total Cache</a> (totally free), <a href="http://wp-rocket.me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Rocket</a> (paid, but worth it), and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/comet-cache/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comet Cache</a> (free and paid options).
</p>
<p>You can find even more tips and tools for browser caching and learn all the easy ways you can leverage it right <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/how-leverage-browser-caching/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Upgrade your hosting plan</strong></h2>
<p>&#8220;Upgrading&#8221; is not a word you want to hear when the budget is tight, but it may be the only way to get your WordPress website running at top speed.
</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve checked everything else and the need for speed still stands, then chances are you&#8217;re getting more traffic than what your poor hosting server can handle.
</p>
<p>When choosing a hosting plan, you need to make sure it can accommodate the size and expected popularity of your website. Otherwise, it&#8217;ll only sputter and struggle to load your pages and effectively frustrate all your visitors.
</p>
<p>Sometimes all it takes is forking out a little extra dough each month, but other times you need to switch to a faster and better hosting provider altogether. It sounds like a lot, we know, so we made a <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/best-web-hosting-small-business-website/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beginner&#8217;s guide to web hosting</a> so you know which option is best for your webite.    </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Need a hand with your WordPress website?</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, you&#8217;re already much savvier than most small business owners when it comes to making WordPress websites faster. But taking out the time to fix it all yourself isn&#8217;t something everybody wants to bother with.
</p>
<p>If you need to take a load off your plate and want to stop bleeding money due to your painfully slow website, send us a quick message and tell us how we can help your business run smoother.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creating your very own small business website sure is exciting. That is until you realize everything that&#8217;s actually involved. </p>
<p>But this isn&#8217;t the 90s anymore. Nowadays you can simply pick a theme and whip up a professional looking website to bring in the traffic and nail those sales.</p>
<p>We can already hear you muttering, &#8220;Yeah, but it&#8217;s easier said than done,&#8221; and you&#8217;re right. But you know what? Building a website is one of the most powerful things you can do for your business. With most of society constantly connected to the internet, putting your biz online skyrockets your exposure and brings you closer to financial freedom (or a yacht).</p>
<p>So whether you&#8217;re finally bringing your business to the 21st century or simply hoping to quit your day job, here&#8217;s a straightforward small business website checklist so you can be sure you&#8217;ve covered all your bases.</p>
<h2>Make your website SEO-friendly</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing, good SEO = higher ranking in search results. </p>
<p>Essentially, the better you rank in search engines, like Google, the more exposure your business gets. While you can always hire a fancy SEO expert to really dig into it, there are a few basic things you can do yourself to lift your website off the ground.</p>
<h3>Insert keywords in titles, meta-descriptions, and tags</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t do SEO without keywords. If you already know which keywords your business is targeting then you&#8217;re miles ahead. On the other hand, if you&#8217;re just getting started you can use free tools like <a href="https://adwords.google.com/intl/en_ca/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Keyword Planner</a>, <a href="https://keywordtool.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keyword Tool</a>, and <a href="https://answerthepublic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Answer The Public</a> to see what your audience is typing.</p>
<p>Once you have a list of your top 3-5 keywords, put them in your titles, headers, links, and tags. For example, if you want your homepage to attract people searching for &#8220;disco dog collars&#8221;, use the top keywords used in dog collar web searches. </p>
<p>Pay special attention to the places that people see when deciding whether to click on your website or not. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3416 size-full" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bilimoria-tech-reviews.png" alt="screenshot of bilimoria search engine listing" width="598" height="132" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bilimoria-tech-reviews.png 598w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bilimoria-tech-reviews-300x66.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></p>
<p>Note how the keyword &#8220;Bilimoria Technologies&#8221; (that&#8217;s us) is in the blue title, the green link (URL), and the meta-description. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re running your website on WordPress, you can install nifty plugins like<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> All In One SEO Pack</a> or <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YoastSEO</a> which make sure you fill in all those important fields for every page on your website.</p>
<h3><strong>Track your traffic with Google Analytics</strong></h3>
<p>After you&#8217;ve done your SEO homework, you&#8217;re going to want to see if it&#8217;s working. There&#8217;s plenty of software available to track your web analytics, but for beginners, it&#8217;s safer to go with <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a>. (Plus it&#8217;s free.)</p>
<p>All you have to do is head over there, create an account, and then verify that your website is actually yours (and you&#8217;re not trying to spy on someone else&#8217;s). After that, you can check your dashboard to see how many people are coming in, what they&#8217;re clicking on, and where your SEO is falling flat.</p>
<h3>Fill it with clear and consistent content</h3>
<p>Content is a major driver of clicks, and the whole point of getting a website is to show people that you have what they need. The only way to do that is with good content. </p>
<p>For content that draws in eyeballs and gets fingers clicking, try to hit everything on this list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branding:</strong> Your logo should be in the top left corner and your brand name should be the first thing they read, followed by a tagline that tells them <em>exactly</em> what you offer. (Don&#8217;t say &#8220;We make quality shoes&#8221;, say &#8220;Custom-made shoes for senior citizens.&#8221; Be as specific as you can.)</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Scannability:</strong> Use short paragraphs (no more than four sentences) and bullet points whenever you can. Remember, people don&#8217;t read online, they <em>skim</em>.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Easy-to-read:</strong> Avoid the quirky lingo and unexplained acronyms. Read your content out loud to make sure it sounds like something an actual human would say in a conversation. If it sounds salesy or unnatural, cut it out.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> Use good quality images and videos to complement your text. Be careful though, these can be heavy and tend to slow down your website. (We&#8217;ll talk a bit more about that later.)</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Blog:</strong> Most companies use a blog to bring in more views. If you don&#8217;t have the time (or the money to hire someone), just focus on essential content like the homepage, about page, services, FAQ, and contact page.</li>
<p></p>
<li><strong>Call to action:</strong> What do you want their next step to be? Do you want them to subscribe to your newsletter? Click the giant orange button to buy your product? Tell them what to do with a helpful call to action (CTA).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a small business homepage that includes all of these things:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3418 size-full" src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot.png" alt="Screenshot of Topspot homepage" width="1411" height="797" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot.png 1411w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot-300x169.png 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot-768x434.png 768w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Topspot-1024x578.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1411px) 100vw, 1411px" /></p>
<p>See? Plus, they have what we&#8217;re about to cover next.</p>
<h3>Add social media</h3>
<p>Have you noticed that search engines are showing more content from social media? That&#8217;s because social content is highly valued nowadays and it would do you good to join the movement. Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn are major social networks where you&#8217;ll want to make your presence known.</p>
<p>But hold on there, don&#8217;t just create the pages and hope people will find you. Be active on them, promote your services and add the social icons on every page of your website. (A good place to put them is in the header and/or footer since those are present on every page of your website.)</p>
<h2>Speed: Optimize your website</h2>
<p><a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Website speed</a> is just as important as SEO. In fact, slow websites can <em>actually hurt</em> your SEO. To make matters worse, websites that take more than two seconds to load <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lose 53% of potential customers</a>. Harsh, but true. </p>
<p>So to keep your visitors happy and increase your chances of turning them into customers, here are a few essentials to <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">optimize your website</a>.</p>
<h3>Compress your images</h3>
<p>Remember when we said images and videos can be really heavy and slow down your site? Well, this is how you can nip that in the bud. Compressing images simply means making them smaller so your website can load them faster.</p>
<p>Unless you have a website developer doing this for you, go ahead and use free tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TinyPNG</a> or the desktop app <a href="http://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RIOT</a> to really slim those images down before adding them to your site. </p>
<p>For WordPress websites, simply install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WP Smush</a> plugin and it&#8217;ll take care of your images automatically.</p>
<h3>Make it mobile-friendly</h3>
<p>Fun fact: <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1185/mobile-commerce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">40% of online shoppers</a> are on mobile. This means you need to make your website fast and easy for them to access on their devices. </p>
<p>Luckily, it&#8217;s easy to find a website theme that&#8217;s already mobile-friendly, but once you start adding this and tweaking that, you&#8217;ll find that not everything fits perfectly on the small screen anymore.</p>
<p>Since you&#8217;re just starting out, you don&#8217;t have to worry about the effects of customization just yet (but keep it in mind). Right now, simply take extra care to choose a website theme that explicitly says it&#8217;s &#8220;responsive&#8221; or &#8220;mobile-friendly&#8221;. This way you can focus on your content without worrying if it&#8217;s going to look like a Picasso on mobile.</p>
<h3>Run it through a speed test</h3>
<p>To make sure your website is making the cut, you can copy and paste your web link into <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google’s PageSpeed Insights</a>. It&#8217;ll give you a score and then a bunch of advice on what needs to be improved. <br />
<strong>Fair warning:</strong> Google&#8217;s advice can get a little technical, but you can find every point explained (in plain English) in this enlightening <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website speed guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Bonus: Add a lazy loading plugin</h3>
<p>E-commerce websites tend to be very image-heavy and this can really slow things down. There&#8217;s a little trick called Lazy Loading where you can make the important images show faster. To get the scoop on this nifty tactic, head over to our <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultimate Guide for Lazy Loading Images</a>.</p>

<h2>Design: Make it easy on the eyes</h2>
<p>Humans are instinctively drawn to beautiful things. If your website is easy on the eyes then you&#8217;ll have a leg up on all those Quasimodo-looking sites out there. Here&#8217;s how you can drastically reduce your chances of ending up with an ugly website.</p>
<h3>Start with an aesthetic theme</h3>
<p>If you stick to an attractive theme it&#8217;s pretty hard to mess it up. You don&#8217;t need to be an expert designer to make a beautiful website. Just follow the theme, use quality images, and have the common sense to not put red text on a red background.</p>
<h3><strong>Stick to 3-4 colors</strong></h3>
<p>Okay, usually themes have color pickers and here is where it can all go wrong. We get it, colors add pizzazz to any website. But there&#8217;s no need to use the entire rainbow. </p>
<p>All you really need is a white background, black/grey text, and two other colors to make a few titles and buttons stand out. That&#8217;s it. If you&#8217;re clueless at choosing colors, use this nifty <a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">color theme generator</a> to find your perfect business hues.</p>
<h3>Keep it simple</h3>
<p>Resist the temptation to fill in every empty corner of your website. White space makes it look clean and uncluttered, so allow your content to breathe and don&#8217;t stuff in a billion images and ten different fonts. </p>

<h2>Need a hand setting up your website?</h2>
<p>While this small business website checklist is pretty short and sweet (if we may say so ourselves), it doesn&#8217;t cover <em>everything</em> you need to know. There&#8217;s hosting, customized features, advanced optimization &#8212; you name it. If this is your very first website it can be a lot to take in, so it doesn&#8217;t hurt if you get someone who has more experience to help you out.</p>
