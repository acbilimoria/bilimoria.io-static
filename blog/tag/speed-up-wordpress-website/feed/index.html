								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your small business website running on WordPress? If yes, then you&#8217;re part of the popular crowd. According to <a href="https://wordpress.com/about/?aff=2718" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent stats</a>, WordPress powers about 26% of the world wide web.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no surprise everyone has jumped onto the WordPress train considering it&#8217;s the most powerful and versatile Content Management Systems (CMS) out there. From small travel blogs and burgeoning business websites to Fortune 500s like Sony Music and Forbes blog. WordPress is a force to be reckoned with.
</p>
<p>The problem with WordPress (and most websites) is that it&#8217;s easy to overstuff it with plugins, leave broken links unattended, and bog it down with heavy media. The good news is that all of this and all other slow-loading WordPress problems can be fixed. Quite easily, we might add.
</p>
<p>So, settle into your chair, grab a pen and get ready to learn:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Why your WordPress website is slower than a dial-up connection.</li>
<li>How to check for performance issues in just two clicks.</li>
<li>Five easy tips to kick your slow WordPress website into warp speed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Reasons your WordPress website is slow</strong></h2>
<p>Slow websites are the stone in the internet&#8217;s shoe. They&#8217;re annoying and they happen more often than anyone would like.
</p>
<p>When you have a small business website that&#8217;s already struggling for attention, the last thing you need is for it to load at the speed of nothing. In fact, according to SEO guru, <a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/loading-time/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Neil Patel</a>, here are a few major reasons how laggy sites can sabotage your business goals.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Slower loading times equal more page abandonments. After 2-3 seconds, poof.</li>
<li>Page speed is a ranking signal at Google. The slower you load, the lower you go. </li>
<li>79% of online shoppers never return to a low-performing website.</li>
<li>Every three seconds you make a visitor wait decreases their satisfaction by 16%.</li>
<li>One second delay can result in a 7% reduction in conversions. Ouch.</li>
</ul>
<p>We won&#8217;t go into too much detail about site speed here (we already did that in our post on <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/website-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Everything You Need To Know About Web Speed</a>), so we&#8217;ll jump right into the top reasons why your website is being a right pain.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s bloated with plugins, old scripts, and unused links.</li>
<li>Your hosting provider can&#8217;t keep up with the traffic.</li>
<li>You have way too many heavy images.</li>
<li>Your website isn&#8217;t leveraging caching to load pages faster.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Feeling slightly overwhelmed already? That&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;re here to guide you through it all. Of course, if you&#8217;d rather just have us speed up your website for you so you can focus on other things (like growing your business), drop us a quick message <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>In any case, here&#8217;s how to fix all of these issues and more with a bit of research, the right tools, and some elbow grease.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>First, check how fast your site is loading</strong></h2>
<p>You won&#8217;t know how grave your situation is until you actually check your website speed. You can do this in just a couple of clicks and using tools like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> (free), <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/?logout" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GTMetrix</a> (also free), and <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/product/page-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Pingdom</a> (14-day trial).
</p>
<p><img src="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Pingdom speed test tool" width="960" height="569" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3583" srcset="https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test.jpg 960w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test-300x178.jpg 300w, https://bilimoria.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/pagespeed-test-768x455.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" />
</p>
<p>All you have to do is paste your website link and then all will be revealed. If you&#8217;re still not sure whether your website is much faster or slower than most in your industry, check <a href="https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/average-page-load-times-websites-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this page</a> to see how you compare with the current average load times. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Review your plugins</strong></h2>
<p>We know. You love WordPress plugins. The simplicity of installing an entire function on your website without needing any meddling developers is a wonderful thing. Except, every plugin you install adds another bucket of code on your website, and over time, all these scripts and stylesheets slow down your website.
</p>
<p>So what to do? Well, there&#8217;s no other way around it other than manually going through your list of installed plugins and deleting the ones you don&#8217;t <em>really</em> need. If you can replace four individual plugins with an all-in-one version, then do it. In general, 20 plugins is the recommended number for WordPress websites.
</p>
<p>Avoid having multiple plugins that do the same thing (like SEO plugins, for example), and if you have a plugin that you don&#8217;t really understand the point of, <a href="https://bilimoria.io/contact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ask a developer</a> for advice.
</p>
<p>By the way, if you have 30-50+ plugins installed to make your WordPress website just the way you want it, then it&#8217;s very likely you could be in need of a new theme that eliminates the need for all that extra baggage. </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Optimize your images</strong></h2>
<p>Images are the best and worst part of any WordPress website. They bring life to what would be a dull, text-laden site but they also weigh it down and slow down page loading times.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, images are easy to optimize. Here are a few things you can do to ensure your images aren&#8217;t bogging down your site.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize the images in Photoshop using the “Save for Web” feature. (PNGs are lighter than JPEGs.)</li>
<li>Run your images through free image optimization tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a>.</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Smush</a> plugin to automatically reduce image sizes.</li>
<li>If you have an extensive image gallery on a page, try <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lazy loading them</a>.</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Check for broken links and redundant redirects</strong></h2>
<p>Links that are doing nothing other than cluttering your database have no place in your new, ultra-fast WordPress website. There are plenty of free tools that will give you a list of broken links like <a href="https://www.drlinkcheck.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dr. Link Check</a> and <a href="https://www.deadlinkchecker.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dead Link Checker</a>.
</p>
<p>As for redirects, think of these as connecting flights where the more connections you have to take the longer it&#8217;ll take you to reach your final destination. Some redirects are good, but too many will bring your page response time crashing down.
</p>
<p>Use good ol&#8217; <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google PageSpeed</a> to see which redirects are lowering your speed score. Another is<br />
<a href="https://varvy.com/tools/redirects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Redirect Mapper Tool</a>, that focuses on how many redirects your main website URL is putting visitors through.</p>
<p>
Once you&#8217;ve identified the culprits, you can go ahead and start deleting the redirects your website could do without.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Enable browser caching</strong></h2>
<p>Caching is a nifty technique where rarely-changed elements on your website (like your logo, background, etc.) are stored on the visitor&#8217;s computer. So the next time they visit your website, there&#8217;s no need to wait for all those things to download again. This makes your website load twice as fast since half the work has already been done.
</p>
<p>Not only does it save on bandwidth, it also provides a better experience for mobile users (which is more than <a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">52% of all online traffic</a>) – who also happen to be the most impatient.
</p>
<p>To get this magic-sounding thing working for your own WordPress website, the easiest way is to install a plugin. Yes, we know we told you to avoid bloating your website with plugins but technically you&#8217;re allowed 20 and this one is important.
</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Total Cache</a> (totally free), <a href="http://wp-rocket.me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Rocket</a> (paid, but worth it), and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/comet-cache/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Comet Cache</a> (free and paid options).
</p>
<p>You can find even more tips and tools for browser caching and learn all the easy ways you can leverage it right <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/how-leverage-browser-caching/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Upgrade your hosting plan</strong></h2>
<p>&#8220;Upgrading&#8221; is not a word you want to hear when the budget is tight, but it may be the only way to get your WordPress website running at top speed.
</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve checked everything else and the need for speed still stands, then chances are you&#8217;re getting more traffic than what your poor hosting server can handle.
</p>
<p>When choosing a hosting plan, you need to make sure it can accommodate the size and expected popularity of your website. Otherwise, it&#8217;ll only sputter and struggle to load your pages and effectively frustrate all your visitors.
</p>
<p>Sometimes all it takes is forking out a little extra dough each month, but other times you need to switch to a faster and better hosting provider altogether. It sounds like a lot, we know, so we made a <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/best-web-hosting-small-business-website/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">beginner&#8217;s guide to web hosting</a> so you know which option is best for your webite.    </p>
<p><strong></p>
<h2>Need a hand with your WordPress website?</strong></h2>
<p>At this point, you&#8217;re already much savvier than most small business owners when it comes to making WordPress websites faster. But taking out the time to fix it all yourself isn&#8217;t something everybody wants to bother with.
</p>
<p>If you need to take a load off your plate and want to stop bleeding money due to your painfully slow website, send us a quick message and tell us how we can help your business run smoother.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>First of all: What is page speed?</strong></h2>
<p>In a nutshell, page speed is how long it takes for everything on a page to load. We can get into the techy details later. All you need to know now is that the faster your page loads, the better.
</p>
<p>Why, you ask? Well, it gives your customers what they want (which helps your conversions), and boosts your ranking in search results (so more customers can find you).</p>
<h3><strong>SEO Best Practices</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s the bad news: <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">Google considers page speed</a> when deciding how well you rank. This means the slower your page is, the less likely you’ll be in the top three search results. It also means users won’t stay on your site long enough to even know what you have to offer.
</p>
<p>In fact, <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/10-reasons-website-can-high-bounce-rate/182260/">studies show</a> that if your page isn’t up and running by the time they blink, they’ll sigh and go elsewhere. That’s a red flag in Google’s eyes.
</p>
<p>Bottom line is, slow pages hurt your SEO. The good news is, you can do something about it. Here are a few starting points:</p>
<p><b>Reduce response time:</b> Response time is how long it takes for your page to show minimal signs of life when users click on a link to it. Just so you know, one <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">survey</a> revealed that nearly half of web users will jump ship after a mere <i>three</i> second delay in page response time. Scary. We know.</p>
<p><b>Speed it up on mobile: </b>In the good ol’ days, you could enjoy a pretty decent ranking even with sluggish loading times on mobile. But Google has put its mighty foot down, and now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/google-will-make-page-speed-a-factor-in-mobile-search-ranking-starting-in-july/">page speed on mobile</a> is a major factor for search ranking. This means laggy pages on mobile can seriously hurt your overall SEO. Plus, you’ll want to get on this pronto considering <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1185/mobile-commerce/">39% of online shoppers</a> are on mobile.</p>
<p><b>Check your page speed:</b> By now you’re probably wondering, “Okay, so how do I know my page speed?” That’s easy. You can run it through <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google’s PageSpeed Insights</a>. You just put in a web page URL (the link), and you get your very own speed score. It’s even nice enough to tell you what’s slowing your page down and what you can do about it. Pretty neat, right?</p>
<h2><strong>What is website speed?</strong></h2>
<p>Now this is important. Website speed is how fast your website loads overall, and it’s in your best interest to makes yours quick. With literally billions of websites clamoring for attention, users won’t hesitate to skip your slow-loading site and head off to your speedier competitor.
</p>
<p>Seem unfair? Well, think of it this way: In a room full of potential employees, would you hire the candidate who freezes up and takes five seconds before answering every question? Nope. If they’re slow now, it’s only going to be frustrating working with them later. First impressions are important.
</p>
<p>Same rules apply online. If you’re slow, you lose the dough. Capisce?</p>
<h2><strong>Why website speed matters</strong></h2>
<p>You may be kidding yourself in thinking, “But my website is seriously cool, surely they’ll wait a couple seconds longer!” No, they will not.
</p>
<p>People are impatient, especially online, and if they want something, they want it <i>now</i>.</p>
<p>But don’t take it from us, here are some cold, hard facts on why you should care about website speed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Websites that take more than two seconds to load <a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/">lose 53% of potential customers</a>.</li>
<li>Google penalizes slow websites and <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">ranks fast websites higher</a>.</li>
<li>Faster websites improve User Experience. <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">79% of shoppers</a> won’t return to a website if it was frustratingly slow the first time.</li>
<li>People want speed! On mobile, <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">85% of users</a> expect the site to load as fast or faster than on desktop.</li>
<li>A single-second delay can <a href="https://www.akamai.com/uk/en/about/news/press/2017-press/akamai-releases-spring-2017-state-of-online-retail-performance-report.jsp">reduce conversions by 7%</a>. So if you make $5,000 per day from your e-commerce site, then that one second will cost you $125,000 in lost revenue. Ouch.</li>
<li>Fun fact: Walmart reported a <a href="http://www.globaldots.com/how-website-speed-affects-conversion-rates/">2% increase in conversions</a> for every one-second improvement in their site speed.</li>
<li>Extra fun fact: Mozilla got <a href="http://www.globaldots.com/how-website-speed-affects-conversion-rates/">60 million more Firefox downloads</a> per year by making their pages a mere 2.2 seconds faster. Every second counts!</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How do I speed up my website?</strong></h2>
<p>We’re glad you’ve arrived at this point, because we don’t want you leaving money on the table over a couple seconds delay. Now, hold onto your breeches while we show you how to get your website into warp speed.</p>
<h3><strong>Enable compression</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s a non-surprise for you: Your website is made of code. It’s what makes every page look just how you want it. Text here, image there, logo in the corner, etc.
</p>
<p>But code is like a suitcase. The heavier it is, the longer it’ll take you to move it. If that suitcase were, say, smaller and lighter, then you can be off and running. That’s where compression comes in.
</p>
<p>You’re going to want to make that bulky code of yours smaller, so use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/">Gzip</a>. It’s a nifty application that compresses files that are much too large. <b>Warning:</b> Don’t use it for images, unless you want them to end up looking like one giant pixel. We’ll get to how you can optimize images later.</p>
<h3><strong>Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML</strong></h3>
<p>Wait, wait. Don’t glaze over just yet, we promise to keep it simple. Let’s go back to the suitcase analogy. Making a bulky suitcase more compact is great on its own, but if you could take out the extra odds and ends that you don’t really need, then it’s going to be a whole lot lighter.
</p>
<p>That’s what minifying code does, and there are plenty of ways to do it. But Google knows best, and it <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/MinifyResources">recommends these minifying tools</a>. See? We told you it would be simple.</p>
<h3><strong>Reduce redirects</strong></h3>
<p>You know when a road is closed off and there’s that poor guy standing in the middle of traffic waving his arms around telling cars where to go?
</p>
<p>Website redirects are kind of like that guy. They automatically take users on your website to the new location of something you previously moved or deleted.</p>
<p>The problem is, like with the traffic example, they make users take longer to get to where they want to be.
</p>
<p>Check out these suggestions from Google on <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rtt#AvoidRedirects">how to avoid redirects</a>. You can also give your pages a shakedown using the <a href="https://varvy.com/tools/redirects/">redirect mapper tool</a> to know exactly which redirects you can clean up.</p>
<h3><strong>Remove render-blocking JavaScript</strong></h3>
<p>Website browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) have to process scripts of code to make things on your website load. Turns out that JavaScript is like that one guy in front of the line at Starbucks who won&#8217;t let anyone go ahead until they’re done ordering a 12-ingredient latte. So <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/remove-javascript-rendering-block" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check this post</a> on how you can stop that script from holding up the line.</p>
<h3><strong>Leverage browser caching</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone loves leverage. But first, what in the world is caching? A cache is where bits of website data (pages, images, files, etc.) are stored temporarily so it takes less time to load next time.
</p>
<p>Usually, caches have expiration dates so make sure yours is set to a minimum of one week or a maximum of one year. Actually, you can check when your cache expiration date is with <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/YSlow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this cool tool</a>.</p>
<p><b>Bonus tip:</b> If your website is on WordPress, you can kick back and install the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/">WP Super Cache</a> plugin to manage your cache settings.</p>
<p><strong>Extra bonus tip:</strong> We like to think we&#8217;re nice people, so we did the digging for you and wrote up a complete guide on everything you need to know about <a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/how-leverage-browser-caching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">browser caching and how to leverage it</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Improve server response time</strong></h3>
<p>You may already know what a server is (hint: it’s where your website lives), but you probably didn’t know the ideal server response time is 200ms.
</p>
<p>That’s a pretty short time for your server to show a user what they want after clicking a button on your website. There are a bunch of factors that may be slowing down your server response time, but <a href="https://www.keycdn.com/support/server-response-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here are some tips</a> on how to improve it.</p>
<h3><strong>Optimize images</strong></h3>
<p>Images are great for your website, but if they’re heavy, they can really slow your loading time down. Ask your designer to optimize the images in Photoshop using the “Save for Web” feature before sending them over to you.
</p>
<p>If you’re doing this solo (all the power to you), use free tools like <a href="https://tinypng.com/">TinyPNG</a> or the desktop app <a href="http://luci.criosweb.ro/riot/">RIOT</a> to really slim those images down. For WordPress websites, install the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/">WP Smush</a> plugin to have it all done automatically. Lucky you.</p>
<h3><strong>Don’t Rely on HTML to resize images</strong></h3>
<p>We know how it is. You have a huge image but it looks great so you upload it to your website as is. Your website then does that cool thing where it scales the image down for you. Neat, right?
</p>
<p>Not really. Your browser is essentially swallowing a watermelon to give you a seed. If you’re going to use a small image, upload the image in the size you need to shave a few seconds off your loading time. Every second counts!</p>
<h3><strong>Combine background images into sprites</strong></h3>
<p>We mean “sprites” as in a collection of images &#8211; not the sodas. Basically, a sprite takes a bunch of separate images and flattens them into just one, so your server only has to get one file instead of five or six (which would take longer). Creating a sprite isn’t hard at all. In fact, you can generate them for free <a href="http://cssspritestool.com/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/css/sprite-generator">here</a>, and <a href="https://wearekiss.com/spritepad">here</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoid image hotlinking</strong></h3>
<p>Hotlinking is actually a pretty common problem. It&#8217;s when people link to your files and images but show them on their own website. This means that users can view them on that other website, but <i>your</i> server will be the one loading them up.
</p>
<p>So not only will your server be handling your own traffic, it’ll be slowed down by their traffic too. Sneaky, right? Good news is that you can protect your server from these fiendish leeches with these awesome <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/hotlinking/#plugin">tips for preventing hotlinking</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Prioritize above-the-fold content (lazy loading)</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://bilimoria.io/blog/lazy-loading-images-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lazy loading</a> is about as good as it sounds. When users first arrive on your website, they’re only going to be looking at the top part (i.e. Above the fold).
</p>
<p>You can get your website to show that top part a lot faster by telling it to only load the rest of the page when the user starts scrolling down. It’s a “what you see is what you get” kind of approach. This <a href="http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload">Lazy Load plugin</a> will help you get the job done.</p>
<h3><strong>Concatenate files</strong></h3>
<p>Remember how we said you should <a>combine images into sprites</a> so the server spends less time getting multiple files? Same goes for a lot of other files.
</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb is that if you have a bunch of files with similar functions (e.g. image manipulation), then it’s a good idea to concatenate them. The <a href="https://wp-rocket.me/">WP Rocket plugin</a> helps you out with this during development.</p>
<h3><strong>Reduce website plugins</strong></h3>
<p>You may have noticed we’ve been throwing out a lot of WordPress plugins. That’s because they’re a pretty simple way to get things done, but there is also the danger of installing too many of these bad boys.
</p>
<p>Every plugin takes up resources that make your website slower and heavier. So try reducing your plugins or replacing a handful of them with an “all-in-one” plugin instead.<b> Pro tip:</b> The <a href="http://wpcurve.com/wordpress-speed/"> recommended number of plugins</a> is actually 20.</p>
<h3><strong>Avoid bad requests</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine being sent to pick up an order from a restaurant only to find the restaurant doesn’t exist anymore. You’d probably walk around the block to make sure you didn’t just miss it. Then you’d end up going home empty-handed and sulking because that dead end mission just took a chunk of time out of your busy day.
</p>
<p>Your browser feels your pain. Sometimes your website links to files and images that have been deleted or moved elsewhere. Think about those dreaded “Error 404” messages. No-one likes them.
</p>
<p>Good guy <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/#?modal_active=none">Google Analytics</a> usually gives you a heads up when something is missing, but you can also run your website through a free <a href="http://www.brokenlinkcheck.com/find-broken-links.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> broken link checker</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Specify a character set</strong></h3>
<p>Long story short: machines don’t understand human-speak. They use character sets which is like a code key for them to know which numbers and letters to show us online.
</p>
<p>There are various character sets to choose from but the dominating one is called UTF-8. By declaring this to your browser, you’ll save it from searching around for one before loading a page on your website. You have to <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-html-encoding-declarations"> specify a character set in HTML</a>, so maybe poke a developer about it to save yourself the headache.</p>
<h3><strong>Reduce DNS lookups</strong></h3>
<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System, and it’s basically a translator for the World Wide Web. Every website has an IP address (like every person has an ID number), but no one is going to remember all those numbers, so what DNS does is take them and translate them into a friendly name, like “Google.com”.
</p>
<p>On the flip side, when you type “Google.com” into your browser, DNS translates it back into its numerical IP address so the Internet can do its thing behind the scenes. The problem is that it takes time for DNS to lookup who’s who. Before you can do anything about it, you need to know who is taking the longest. Run your website through <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/pingdom-speed-test/"> Pingdom</a> or <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/"> WebPageTest</a> to pinpoint the culprits.</p>
<h3><strong>Enable HTTP Keep-Alive</strong></h3>
<p>Okay, first you need to know what HTTP is. It’s essentially the messenger between a browser and the server where all your files and images are kept. When a user clicks to see a page, HTTP is the loyal steed who goes and asks the server for all the files.
</p>
<p>Now, every time HTTP goes and requests a file it has to open a connection. When the request is over, the connection closes. Then it has to open it all over again for the next request. It’s like having to unlock a door and then lock it again over and over. That takes up precious time.
</p>
<p>What Keep-Alive does is leave the doors unlocked while HTTP asks for a bunch of files in one go. Some websites have this already enabled, so use <a href="https://www.giftofspeed.com/check-keep-alive/"> this tool</a> to check if yours does.</p>
<h3><strong>Use HTTP2</strong></h3>
<p>Wait, first it was HTTP and now it’s HTTP2? What’s the deal? Don’t panic, this new kid on the block is just a faster and better version of the classic. With this snazzy new version you no longer have to <a> concatenate files</a> or <a> generate image sprites</a> to speed up your loading time.
</p>
<p>The best part is that if your website is already running HTTPS (check the address bar after your website loads), then you can probably start using HTTP2. You might need to have a chat with your hosting provider first though.</p>
<h3><strong>Switch to PHP7</strong></h3>
<p>Is your trusty website running on WordPress? Well, you’re in for a treat. PHP is the programming language WordPress is built on, and now you can upgrade to the all <a href="https://torquemag.io/2017/05/compelling-reasons-you-should-switch-to-php-7/"> new and improved PHP7</a>. It’s lightyears faster than older versions of PHP and it’s easier for developers to work with too. You can know right now if your website can be upgraded with this <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/"> PHP7 compatibility checker</a>.</p>
<h3>Use a PHP Accelerator</h3>
<p>Speaking of PHP, if you find that your website isn’t compatible to upgrade to the latest version then there are still ways you can make it load faster. Check out these free PHP accelerators like <a href="https://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/what-is/speed-up-php-with-apc"> ACP</a>, <a href="https://www.tecmint.com/install-xcache-to-accelerate-and-optimize-php-performance/"> XCache</a>, and <a href="http://eaccelerator.net/"> eAccelerator</a>. You just can’t beat free.</p>
<h3>Activate AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)</h3>
<p>We sure love accelerating things around here. AMP is a project by Google to help you give your website a <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/">speed boost on mobile</a>. It won’t affect your ranking (yet), but it’s worth looking into since big shots like <i>Wired</i>, <i>Gizmodo</i>, and <i>The Washington Post</i> are already using it.</p>
<h3>Remove query strings from static resources</h3>
<p>That seems like a mouthful, but it’s not as bad as it looks. The important thing here is that query strings on static resources can slow loading times down. A static resource can be a file or an image (e.g. your logo) which will always stay the same. To remove these pesky query strings you can either be brave and tweak your theme files, or install this handy <a href="https://www.w3-edge.com/products/w3-total-cache/"> W3 Total Cache</a> plugin.</p>
<h3>Serve resources from a consistent URL</h3>
<p>As you may know, every file and image on your website is a resource, and each resource has its own URL. But sometimes you have that one cool video you want to show off in every page, but then that video gets duplicated and each version has a different URL.
</p>
<p>This means the browser has to download a “different video” every time instead of just the one. Although plugins and redirects can also be to blame for inconsistent URLs, so check out how to solve every situation right <a href="https://wpbloggingnerd.org/how-to-serve-resources-from-a-consistent-url/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a>.</p>
<h3>Optimize your database</h3>
<p>Just like your laptop, the more information your database has, the slower it’s going to work. There’s probably a lot of useless data cramping up your website’s database, so it’s a good idea to give it a clean every so often. Of course, there’s a plugin for that. Feel free to install <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/"> WP-Optimize</a> to give your ol’ database some much-needed maintenance.</p>
<h3>Use a Content Distribution Network (CDN)</h3>
<p>Think of a CDN as if it were an Apple Store. They have stores all over the world to make it faster and easier for people to buy from them. It would be a royal pain if people in Holland had to travel to the U.S. for an iPhone, right?
</p>
<p>Well, same goes for your website. You’re getting hits from all over the world and you want to make it fast and easy for them to buy what you’re selling. So use CDNs to give users better access to your web content from whichever location they’re in. If you want a CDN, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"> Cloudflare</a> or <a href="https://www.maxcdn.com/"> MaxCDN</a> are pretty good places to start.</p>
<h3>Choose the right hosting plan</h3>
<p>Last but not least, there’s your hosting plan. Not everyone catches onto this, but hosting services can actually make your website faster or slower. Usually, when it comes to choosing a hosting plan, you’re looking out for your budget and not really the speed. So you may want to head back over to those hosting features and check if you’re getting the hottest deal.</p>
<h2><b>One more thing</b></h2>
<p>Since websites are awesome but also extremely complicated, it’s always a good idea to have a professional tweak your website for you. They’re also handy to help you figure out how and where to begin &#8211; because let’s face it, there’s a lot to be done! Right now, we’re offering a free consultation for a <i>very</i> limited time.
